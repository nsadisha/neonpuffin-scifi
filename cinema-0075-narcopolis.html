            <p><i>Narcopolis</i>, a low-budget science fiction thriller film written and directed by <i>Justin Trefgarne</i> and produced by <i>T Squared Films</i>, paints a bleak picture of London in 2024, when hard drugs are legalised.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0075-1.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid white;" />

            <p>During the 2020s, the intensive lobbying of the pharmaceutical conglomerate <i>Ambro</i>, founded by <i>Todd Ambro</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Callis" title="James Nicholas Callis, English actor best known for playing Dr. Gaius Baltar in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica television series">James Callis</a>), achieves the unthinkable – all hard drugs are legalised and distributed en masse to the general populace, driving illegal drug trade to the brink of extinction and at the same time bringing immense wealth to <i>Ambro</i> corporation and its shareholders.</p>

            <p>The story opens with <i>Frank Grieves</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Cowan" title="Elliot Cowan, English actor">Elliot Cowan</a>), a police officer and former drug addict, discovering a body at <i>Ambro’s</i> corporate headquarters. What is perplexing, is the fact that in this dystopian future, where everybody’s identity can be confirmed on the spot by a routine lookup in the police database, <i>Grieve’s</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) - a molecule that carries most of the genetic instructions used in the development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms">DNA</a> scanner cannot identify the stranger’s body.</p>

            <p><i>Eddie Rankin</i> (<i>Adam Sims</i>), a forensic medical examiner and friend of <i>Grieves’s</i>, tells him that a trace of an unidentified drug has been found in the man’s body. When examining the evidence from the crime scene under a microscope, <i>Grieves</i> finds the word <i>‘Morlock’</i> inscribed on the sample taken from the body. While <i>Grieves</i> becomes obsessed with solving the dead stranger’s case, his boss, <i>Kim Nolan</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bathurst" title="Robert Guy Bathurst, English actor">Robert Bathurst</a>), does not approve of his investigation and instead orders him to deal with the few remaining illicit street drug dealers, who operate a shrinking black market since the legalisation of all narcotics.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0075-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid white;" />

            <p>Against specific orders to the contrary, <i>Grieves</i> returns to the site of the crime in search of more clues, but instead of answers he finds here an enigmatic young woman, <i>Eva Gray</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lodie_Yung" title="Élodie Yung, French television and film actress">Élodie Yung</a>), who also doesn’t have any record in the DNA database, which further mystifies <i>Grieves</i>. <i>Gray</i> is targeted by an unknown assailant and <i>Grieves</i> saves her life, only to find that the attacker has vanished into thin air. <i>Grieves</i> hopes to gain some insight into the deepening mystery by questioning <i>Gray</i>, but she uses the first opportunity to escape when he becomes distracted.</p>

            <p>Under duress, <i>Rankin</i> reveals that he knows a Russian scientist, <i>Yuri Sidorov</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Pryce" title="Jonathan Pryce, Welsh actor">Jonathan Pryce</a>), who may be able to shed some light into the origin of the unknown drug. <i>Grieves</i> visits <i>Sidorov</i>, and after paying off <i>Rankin’s</i> debt to him, the scientist tells him to return in 24 hours for answers. Following some more obstructions from <i>Ambro</i> security and his superiors, <i>Grieves</i> returns early to catch <i>Sidorov</i> unprepared and finds here <i>Gray</i>, who, after <i>Grieves</i> threatens to harm the scientist, who is hyper-sensitive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwaves - form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from one meter to one millimeter and with frequencies between 300 MHz (100 cm) and 300 GHz (0.1 cm)">microwaves</a>, by his mobile phone, reveals that she is a time-traveller from the year 2044 – accounting for the non-existence of her record in police DNA database. <i>Grieves</i> dismisses this unlikely explanation and demands to know more about what he believes may be an experimental drug codenamed <i>‘Morlock’</i> trialled by <i>Ambro</i> corporation. Despite <i>Grieves</i> believing she made the whole thing up and demanding the truth from <i>Gray</i>, she sticks to her story.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0075-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid white;" />

            <p>As <i>Grieves</i> transports <i>Gray</i> to a safe location, they are ambushed by <i>Ambro</i> security forces, but before they can get hold of the young woman, her friends appear out of nowhere, take out <i>Ambro</i> personnel, and disappear with <i>Gray</i> after injecting her eye with an unknown substance.</p>

            <p>Witnessing this surreal incident and after <i>Ambro</i> thugs attempt to kidnap his son, <i>Grieves</i> finally realises that <i>Gray</i> was telling the truth and that the body he found earlier is in fact the adult version of his 9-year-old son, <i>Ben</i>, from the present. <i>‘Morlock’</i> – the race of brutish, ape-like humanoids from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Machine" title="The Time Machine - a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells, published in 1895">The Time Machine</a>, a science fiction novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="Herbert George Wells, prolific English writer best known for his science fiction novels">H. G. Wells</a>, the book that <i>Grieves</i> gave to <i>Ben</i> previously – is a secret message from his son, he sent him from the future. Following this revelation, <i>Grieves</i> stops at nothing to find the way to reach <i>Ben’s</i> timeline to try and save his son from his pre-destined fate…</p>

            <p>Depressing, (almost) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir - a cinematic term used to describe dark crime dramas, particularly those that emphasise cynical attitudes">film noir</a>-like setting of dystopian London of the near future (whose denizens seem to spend an inordinate amount of their time loitering in underground garages), a pound-shop version of <i>Rick Deckard</i> in the main role, legal drug dealers dressed like pizza-delivery boys, time-travelling by means of injecting one’s eye with some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug" title="Psychotropic a.k.a. psychoactive drug - a chemical substance that changes brain function and results in alterations in mood, perception or consciousness">psychotropic drug</a> that activates the human brain as the ultimate time machine, <i>Narcopolis</i> has it all. What the film lacks though, is a coherent and credible storyline, more detailed character development, and convincing sense of thrill.</p>
