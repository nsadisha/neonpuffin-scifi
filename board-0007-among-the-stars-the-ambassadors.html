            <p class="shift_paragraph_up"><i>Among the Stars: The Ambassadors</i> is a boxed expansion for the first game in the series, a critically acclaimed <i>Among the Stars</i> board game, which uses card drafting (similarly to the 2010 Belgian board game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Wonders_(board_game)" title="7 Wonders - a 2010 Belgian board game by Antoine Bauza">7 Wonders</a>). Originally published only in Europe by <i>Artipia Games</i>, and unavailable in outlets throughout the rest of the world, it is now brought to the North American, Australian and Asian gamers by <i>Stronghold Games</i>. The expansion features more than 150 new cards. Apart from the <i>Ambassador</i> cards, it also includes more than twenty different new Locations, new Objectives, a new Alien Race, brand new Conflict sets (to replace the original ones, rather than mix with them) as well as additional game elements, alongside the rules, for the 5th and 6th player.</p>
            <p>In the first game of the series, <i>Among the Stars</i>, that takes place in a war-ravaged galaxy where the warring alien races have agreed on a fragile peace in order to face a much bigger threat with the potential to destroy them all, an intergalactic <i>Alliance</i> is established with the aim to build space stations throughout the galaxy with the goal to not only defend against this impending threat, but also to strengthen diplomatic relations and promote trade amongst the alien races.</p>
            <p>Now, in <i>Among the Stars: The Ambassadors</i>, in order to assist in the construction of their space stations, each race has formed a team of <i>Ambassadors</i> to visit other space stations in need. These <i>Ambassadors</i> are willing to offer their services and strengthen the bonds of the newly-formed galactic <i>Alliance</i>.</p>
            <p>The expansion introduces the <i>Ambassadors</i> alongside the addition of a fourth action that allows the players to invite the <i>Ambassadors</i> to their space station and make them part of their council. Each <i>Ambassador</i> comes with a different ability, based on his race’s strengths and capabilities. However, there is limited space in each player’s council so they have to choose wisely who they are going to invite.</p>
