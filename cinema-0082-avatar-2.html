            <p>Two–Three–Four… No, that isn’t a countdown to the launch of a rocket, but the, ever increasing, number of sequels to the epic sci-fi film <i>Avatar</i> promised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Francis Cameron, Canadian filmmaker, screenwriter, director and producer">James Cameron</a>.</p>
            <p>It all started far back in 2006, when <i>James Cameron</i> stated that if Avatar was successful, he hopes to make two more sequels to the film. One year after the film’s premiere, in 2010, he said the movie’s widespread success meant that he would indeed be doing two additional sequels, revealing that he included certain scenes in the first film for possible future story follow-ups. He also added that the sequels would widen the <i>Avatar</i> universe while exploring other moons of the gas giant <i>Polyphemus</i> and said that he is starting to design the ocean ecosystem of <i>Pandora</i> and the other worlds to be included in the story, as the first sequel would likely focus on the ocean of <i>Pandora</i>.</p>

            <blockquote class="white" style="max-width: 340px; float: right">
                <span>
                    We worked out every beat of the story across all films so it all connects as one sort of three-film saga <b>–</b> said James Cameron
                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Elaborating further, <i>Cameron</i> explained that the sequels would continue to follow the exploits of <i>Jake</i> and <i>Neytiri</i>, portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Worthington" title="Samuel Henry John 'Sam' Worthington, British-born Australian actor">Sam Worthington</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Saldana" title="Zoe Saldana-Perego, American actress of Haitian, Puerto Rican and Dominican Republic descent">Zoe Saldana</a>, and that the humans would likely return as the main antagonists of the story. He also confirmed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver" title="Sigourney Weaver, American actress best known for her role as a warrant officer Ellen Ripley in Alien film series">Sigourney Weaver</a> will be returning in the sequels, despite the demise of her character in the first <i>Avatar</i> film. <i>Cameron</i> planned to shoot the two sequels back-to-back and to begin work <i>“once the script is nailed down”</i>.</p>
            <p>Then, in 2012, <i>Cameron</i> for the first time mentioned a possibility of a third sequel. Later that year, he stated that the sequels are being written as <i>“separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film”</i>, with the second one having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film, and with the first one expected to be released in 2015. After that, the sequel count started to go up and the release dates started to slip further back. First, in 2013, it was confirmed that there would indeed be three sequels with release dates moving back to December 2016, 2017 and 2018. Screenwriters were also announced: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Friedman" title="Josh Friedman, American screenwriter best known as writer of the TV series 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'">Josh Friedman</a> for the first sequel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jaffa_and_Amanda_Silver" title="Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, American husband-and-wife team of film screenwriters and producers">Rick Jaffa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jaffa_and_Amanda_Silver" title="Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, American husband-and-wife team of film screenwriters and producers">Amanda Silver</a> for the second, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Salerno" title="Shane Salerno, American screenwriter, director and producer">Shane Salerno</a> for the third one. In addition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gould" title="Steven Charles Gould, American science fiction writer">Steven Gould</a> was approached to write four companion novels based on the films.</p>
            <p>In April 2014, <i>Cameron</i> said that he expected to finish the three scripts within six weeks, and stated that all three sequels were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases. He further explained that although <i>Friedman, Jaffa</i> & <i>Silver</i> and <i>Salerno</i> are each co-writing one sequel with him, initially they all worked together on all three scripts: <i>“I didn’t assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they’d tune out every time we were talking about the other movie.”</i> and continued: <i>“We worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga.”</i></p>
            <p>By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed once more by an additional year, with the first follow-up expected to be released in December 2017 and the last one in 2019, citing <i>Cameron</i> as saying that the screenwriting process is <i>“a complex job”</i>. However, in the beginning of 2016, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="The Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation - one of the six major American film studios">Fox</a> announced that the sequels would not be released on the scheduled dates, without explaining why.</p>

            <blockquote class="white" style="max-width: 340px; float: left">
                <span>
                    With Avatar, James Cameron hopes to create a new global multi-media franchise to rival that of the Star Wars universe
                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>And then the bombshell fell. A few months later, in April 2016, in his announcement at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Theatre_Owners#CinemaCon_.28formerly_ShoWest.29" title="CinemaCon - a major movie theater industry trade show and exposition usually held in Las Vegas in early March of every year">CinemaCon</a> in Las Vegas, <i>James Cameron</i> said that fitting his ideas into three sequels would be <i>“too limiting”</i> (he said the same thing about two sequels a couple of years ago) and that his science fiction opera will now stretch over the full <b><i>four sequels</i></b>, that is 5 (<b><i>five!</i></b>) films in total – count’em – including the original <i>Avatar</i> released in 2009. So far so good – one more sequel can’t be a bad thing, right? Unfortunately, that also means pushing the release dates yet further back, with the gaps between the individual follow-ups also widening. Thus, <i>Avatar 2</i> is now scheduled to be released in December 2020, closely followed by <i>Avatar 3</i> a year later, with the additional two instalments coming out in 2024 and 2025. If you wonder why the 3-year-wide gap between the first and the second couple of sequels, <i>Cameron</i> stated in a November 2017 interview: <i>“Let’s face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don’t make enough money, there’s not going to be a 4 and 5”</i>. This outcome is highly unlikely though, as <i>Avatar</i>, with a profit of $1.5 billion (!), is still the highest-grossing film of all time, so something would have to go terribly wrong for the sequels not performing similarly at the box office. The production of the new <i>Avatar</i> began in September 2017 at various locations in New Zealand, with the first two sequels being filmed simultaneously, and is expected to continue into 2018, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture" title="Motion capture - the process of recording the movement of human actors in filmmaking and video game development and using that information to animate digital characters">motion capture</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery (CGI) - the application of computer graphics to create images in art, video games and films">CGI</a> being added later in the studio.</p>

            <p>Clearly with <i>Avatar</i>, <i>James Cameron</i> aims high and hopes to create a new global multi-media franchise to rival that of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, even if that means that the fans will have to wait another few years before they see the next instalment of the epic saga – over a decade since the first <i>Avatar</i> film hit the cinemas in 2009. We can only hope that it will be worth the wait…</p>
