            <p style="margin-top:20px">Fictional representations of <i>Mars</i> in science fiction genre have been popular for over a century. Interest in <i>Mars</i> has been stimulated by the planet’s dramatic red colour, by its relative proximity to Earth, by early scientific speculations that its surface conditions might be able to support life, and by the tantalising prospect of the human colonisation of <i>Mars</i> in the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>The fascination with the <i>‘Red Planet’</i> was further reinvigorated during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when an optical illusion perceived by astronomers observing <i>Mars</i> using early low-resolution telescopes was erroneously interpreted by astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell" title="Percival Lawrence Lowell, American businessman, author, mathematician and astronomer">Percival Lowell</a> as a complex, seemingly artificial, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_canal" title="Canals on Mars - a network of long straight lines in the equatorial regions of Mars erroneously observed by astronomers using early low-quality telescopes">network of canals</a> left behind by a dying <i>Martian</i> civilization struggling to irrigate the planet’s dry surface.</p>
            <p>Actual spaceflights to the planet <i>Mars</i> in the second half of the 20th century, particularly seminal events such as the landing of the first autonomous mechanized scientific laboratory to successfully operate on <i>Mars</i>, in the 1976’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program" title="Viking programme - a pair of NASA space probes, Viking 1 and Viking 2, sent to Mars in 1975">Viking programme</a> of a pair of space probes by the United States, inspired a great deal of renewed interest in the <i>Mars</i>-related fiction.</p>
            <p>Correspondingly, stories about the <i>‘Red Planet’</i> and its purported inhabitants (benevolent or otherwise) have been a staple of science fiction movies for more than a century, ever since the early days of cinema.</p>

                Red Planet and its purported inhabitants (benevolent or otherwise) have been a continual staple of science fiction movies and TV series since the early days of cinematography.

            <p>Therefore, it comes as a surprise that, until the present day, there hasn’t been published a single specialised book that would be devoted solely to the sub-genre of <i>Mars</i> movies. Now, <i>Thomas Kent Miller</i>, a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" title="NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) - an agency of the United States government responsible for the civilian space programme, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research">NASA</a> employee and a retired magazine editor, tries to fill this gap by presenting the reader with the <i>‘Mars in the Movies’</i> – the encyclopaedic volume containing a comprehensive recapitulation of all movies that ever featured the <i>‘Red Planet’</i>.</p>
            <p>This thorough survey covers 98 more (and less) significant movies, television films and miniseries, as well as direct-to-video productions focusing on <i>Mars</i>. It is clear that the author put some effort into his research, as the Wikipedia lists only 30-or-so Mars-themed films. The features, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Alva Edison, American inventor and businessman">Thomas A. Edison’s</a> 1910’s silent, black-and-white 5-minute short <i>‘A Trip to Mars’</i> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Sir Ridley Scott, influential English film director and producer, best known for his cult sci-fi films Blade Runner and Alien">Ridley Scott’s</a> 2015’s blockbuster <a href="cinema-0072-the-martian.html" title="The Martian - review of the science fiction film">The Martian</a>, the author covers them here all, discussing the movies in their historical context, while also examining the evolution of special effects and different cinematic approaches throughout the years. Where available, cast, crew and production information is provided, along with the plot summary and short quotes from critics, whether praising or disparaging.</p>

            <p><i>Mars in the Movies – A History</i> by <i>Thomas Kent Miller</i> was published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFarland_%26_Company" title="McFarland & Company, Inc. - an independent book publisher based in Jefferson, North Carolina">McFarland & Co</a> and is available in paperback (277 pages) and e-book (Kindle) editions with RRP £36.95 and £11.75 respectively.</p>
