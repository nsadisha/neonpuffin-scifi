            <p><i>The Long Mars</i> (originally titled <i>‘The Long Childhood’</i>) is a science fiction novel written in co-operation between fantasy novelist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett" title="Sir Terence David John 'Terry' Pratchett, English author of fantasy novels">Terry Pratchett</a> and science fiction author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter_%28author%29" title="Stephen Baxter, prolific British science fiction author">Stephen Baxter</a>. It is the third volume in the planned 5-book series <i>The Long Earth</i>.</p>

            <p>The quintuple of books explores the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" title="Many-worlds interpretation, implying that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual 'world' or universe">Many Worlds Theory</a> by imagining the <i>‘Long Earth’</i> – a possibly infinite chain of parallel worlds that are similar to Earth, which were discovered, and can be reached by, means of a simple device called a <i>‘Stepper’</i>. While some of these worlds are almost identical to our Earth (throughout the novels referred to as <i>‘Datum Earth’</i>), others differ in smaller or greater detail, but all have one common feature – they are completely devoid of humans. After the first cautions, on-foot, forays into the <i>Long Earth</i> came the invention of twains – stepwise-enabled airships that made longer, and more daring, expeditions possible.</p>

            <p>And then had come the discovery of the <i>‘Gap’</i>, a place where a freak conjunction of cosmic accidents had left a hole in the sequence of worlds that was the <i>Long Earth</i>, and a new kind of access to space. The chance discovery of the <i>‘Gap’</i> brought a complete revolution in human space flight. From now on, spaceships didn’t need to beat Earth’s gravity – hence, rockets would not be launched upwards towards the sky, but stepwise – into the empty space, where the Earth once was, in the universe next door.</p> 

            <p>The storyline of <i>The Long Mars</i> revolves mainly around four key characters: <i>Willis Linsay</i> – inventor of the <i>‘Stepper’</i> device, <i>Sally Linsay</i> – <i>Willis’s</i> daughter, <i>Joshua Valiente</i> – a <i>‘natural stepper’</i> (an individual who can <i>‘step’</i> without the <i>‘Stepper’</i> device) and <i>Lobsang</i> – a Tibetan motorcycle repairman reincarnated as an artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>In the years following the cataclysmic eruption of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera" title="Yellowstone Caldera, supervolcano located in Yellowstone National Park in the United States">Yellowstone supervolcano</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" title="Yellowstone National Park, a national park located primarily in the U.S. state of Wyoming">Yellowstone National Park</a> in September 2040, there is massive population dislocation as groups, communities, sometimes whole nations flee the ravaged <i>Datum Earth</i> to myriad <i>Long Earth</i> worlds. While the evacuation flow to the stepwise worlds has been intense, still many millions remain on the <i>Datum Earth</i>, and stores of food and water are rapidly diminishing. <i>Sally, Joshua</i>, and <i>Lobsang</i> are all involved in this perilous work when, out of the blue, <i>Sally</i> is contacted by her long-vanished father and inventor of the <i>‘Stepper’</i> device, <i>Willis Linsay</i>. He informs <i>Sally</i> that he is planning a pioneering voyage across the <i>Long Mars</i> and wants her to accompany him on this adventure of a lifetime. But <i>Sally</i> soon learns that <i>Willis</i> has ulterior motives ...</p>

            <p>The narrative of the novel switches between three separate storylines:</p>

            <p>Inventor of the <i>‘Stepper’</i> device <i>Willis Linsay</i>, his daughter <i>Sally</i> and <i>Frank Wood</i>, retired USAF pilot and NASA candidate astronaut, find out that the <i>‘Stepper’</i> works also on Mars, and, via the <i>GapSpace</i> (space-exploration facility taking advantage of the <i>‘Gap’</i>), and the <i>‘Brick Moon’</i> (an artificial satellite-station in the position of the vanished Earth and the <i>‘Houston’</i> of the <i>‘Gap’</i>) reach the red planet, where, using a stepwise-capable glider (as airships wouldn’t work in the thin Martian atmosphere) embark on a fantastic voyage across the <i>Long Mars</i>.</p>

            <p>In the meanwhile, <i>Captain Maggie Kauffman</i> sets out on her own, equally daring exploratory expedition aboard the two brand new US Navy twains, stepwise-capable airships the <i>USS Neil A. Armstrong II</i> and the <i>USS Eugene A. Cernan</i>, leading her ships westwards, out into the far stepwise reaches of the <i>Long Earth</i>, on the great mission of discovery with a target of no less than two hundred million <i>Long Earths</i> – ten times further than was ever attempted before.</p>

            <p>At the same time, <i>Joshua Valiente</i> – a <i>‘natural stepper’</i>, encouraged by <i>Lobsang</i> – a world-wide artificial intelligence that claims to be a reincarnate of a Tibetan motorcycle repairman, starts his search for the <i>‘true’</i> homo sapiens – super-inteligent post-humans who are beginning to emerge from their <i>‘long childhood’</i> – originating in a small pioneer community called <i>Happy Landings</i> located deep in the <i>Long Earth</i>.</p>

            <p>While <i>The Long Mars</i> is, in its core, instantaneously recognisable as a work of <i>‘hard’</i> science fiction, for which is <i>Stephen Baxter</i> known, exploring possibilities of novel space travel, alternate universes, space elevators, non-humanoid civilisations as well as future evolution of our own race, <i>Terry Pratchett</i> enlivens the narrative by peppering it with stepwise-communicating and stepwise-danger-sensing trolls and naturally-stepping elves, who could cross between the step worlds with an extreme precision. While the ‘wow’ factor is long gone with the first book of the series, <i>The Long Mars</i> is nevertheless a solid sci-fi novel and a valid addition to <i>The Long Earth</i> saga.</p>

            <p>The fourth book in the series <i>‘The Long Utopia’</i> is due to be published in June 2015.</p>
