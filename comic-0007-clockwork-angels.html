            <p><i>Clockwork Angels</i> is the 19th studio album by Canadian progressive rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28band%29" title="Rush - a Canadian rock band formed in 1968">Rush</a> and also a title of the science fiction novel, inspired by the album, written by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_J._Anderson" title="Kevin J. Anderson, an American science fiction author">Kevin J.

            <p><i>Kevin J. Anderson</i> said about the album’s [and novel’s] concept: <i>“In a young man’s quest to follow his dreams, he is caught between the grandiose forces of order and chaos. He travels across a lavish, colourful world of steampunk and alchemy, with lost cities, pirates, anarchists, exotic carnivals, and a rigid Watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily life.”</i></p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Following generally favourable reviews of the concept album and the accompanying world concert tour, as well as the success of the novel based on it, <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Peart</i> approached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom!_Studios" title="Boom! Studios - comic book publisher headquartered in Los Angeles, California, United States">Boom! Studios</a> with the proposal of a comic book adaptation. Boom! Studios liked the idea and the six-issue miniseries <i>Clockwork Angels</i> was published between March and November 2014.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The story of <i>Clockwork Angels</i> centres on <i>Owen Hardy</i>, a young man who, like all the other people of <i>Albion</i>, has lived his whole life under the rule of the <i>Watchmaker</i> sitting in his high clock tower in the <i>Crown City</i>, from where he commands the loyalty of his subjects, and makes his announcements, through the beautiful, yet eerie, <i>Clockwork Angels</i>. In this highly ordered world, the whole <i>Owen’s</i> life, and those of all other ordinary citizens, have been planned down almost to the exact second. This perfect order is preyed upon by the elusive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism - a political philosophy that advocates stateless society">Anarchist</a>, who is determined to destroy all the <i>Watchmaker’s</i> meticulous plans.</p>
            <p><i>Owen</i> is the <i>Assistant Apple Orchard Manager</i> in small town of <i>Barrel Arbor</i> who is soon to marry a local girl, <i>Lavinia</i>, not because he loves her, but because that’s the <i>Watchmaker’s</i> plan. <i>Owen</i>, a daydreamer, asks his soon-to-be-bride to join him on the orchard hill at midnight, to have a kiss in the moonlight and watch the late-night steamliner heading toward <i>Crown City</i>.</p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_comics/comic0007-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: none;" />

            <p>To his big disappointment, <i>Lavinia</i> doesn’t show up, so <i>Owen</i> walks down the hill to see the passing steamliner on his own. As the liner passes by, a stowaway pops out from one of the carriages and offers him his hand. <i>Owen</i> hesitates for a fraction of a second, but then, realising that this could be his only chance to see the <i>Crown City</i>, accepts the outstretched hand and gets pulled aboard by the mysterious stranger. After a short ride on the steamliner, <i>Owen</i> eventually realises his dream and gets to see <i>Crown City</i> and the wondrous <i>Clockwork Angels</i> in the <i>Chronos Square</i>. He finds his true love in <i>Francesca</i>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tightrope_walking" title="Tightrope walking (a.k.a. Funambulism) - the art of walking along a thin wire or rope">tightrope walker</a> at the local carnival. <i>Owen’s</i> happiness is short-lived though, when he is mistaken for the <i>Anarchist</i> and chased out of the city by an angry mob. He barely escapes with his life and finds refuge on board a steamship heading for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis" title="Atlantis - a legendary island city-state mentioned in Plato's works 'Timaeus' and 'Critias'">Atlantis</a>.</p>
            <p><i>Owen</i> then embarks on a truly epic, soul-searching journey which takes him to many exotic locations, forgotten lands and lost cities, such as the fabled <i>Atlantis</i> with its <i>Poseidon City</i>, and entangles him in both the <i>Watchmaker’s</i> plans and <i>Anarchist’s</i> scheming, all that while riding aboard magnificent steamships and airship-based steamliners across vast oceans and fighting heinous <i>Wreckers</i> – pirates who lure unwary ships onto rocks by making false lights on dangerous reefs. <i>Owen’s</i> search for the truth slowly leads him to the realisation that this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia - a community or society possessing highly desirable or near perfect qualities">Utopia</a>, this seemingly perfect world he was living in, isn’t as ideal as it seems, and that true happiness may lie in simple things, such as reciprocated love.</p>

            <p>Ostentatiously designed in a way that was intended to please fans of <i>Rush</i> (wooed by the promise of <i>Rush</i> lyrics and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28interaction_design%29" title="Easter egg - an intentional inside joke or hidden message in a literary work or video game">Easter eggs</a> hidden throughout the comic) and devotees of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk" title="Steampunk - a subgenre of science fiction inspired by 19th-century British Victorian era and steam-powered machinery">Steampunk</a> genre alike, the graphic novel, penned by a veteran science fiction writer <i>Kevin J. Anderson</i> (<i>Prelude to Dune</i> trilogy) is surprisingly good for a comic book inspired by a studio album, owing not so much to its, rather mediocre, narrative, as to its refreshingly original watercolour-like illustrations by a relative newcomer to the genre <i>Nick Robles</i>.</p>
