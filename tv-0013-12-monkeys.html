                James Cole (portrayed by Aaron Stanford) is a time traveller who is sent back in time with a task to stop the release of a deadly virus that killed 7 billion people.
            </div>

            <p>The story starts in the year 2043, when <i>James Cole</i> and his partner search the ruins of the post-apocalyptic Earth devastated by a viral plague. They discover a skeleton wearing a wristwatch, which <i>Cole</i> takes, seemingly knowing the wearer intimately.</p>
            <p>We learn that in the year 2017, a deadly virus is released, killing 7 billion people worldwide and causing civilization to collapse. In 2043, a team of scientists led by <i>Katarina Jones</i> invent time travel and recruit <i>James Cole</i> to go back in time and kill the man responsible for the release of the virus and start of the plague, in a one-shot-attempt to reverse the disaster and save humanity.</p>
            <p><i>Cole</i> travels back to 2013, where he kidnaps virologist <i>Cassandra Railly</i> and interrogates her about the whereabouts of <i>Leland Frost</i> – the scientist responsible for the outbreak. <i>Cole</i> explains <i>Railly</i> that he is from the future and that he needs to stop an impending viral pandemic. At first, <i>Railly</i> takes <i>Cole</i> for a lunatic, but she starts to believe his story when he shows her the watch he found in the future, which is completely identical with the watch she is wearing. As she looks in amazement, <i>Cole</i> etches a groove onto the glass of her watch, causing one to appear instantaneously on the watch from the future. Upon discovering that <i>Railly</i> does not know anything about the scientist, who according to his knowledge is responsible for the plague, <i>Cole</i> asks <i>Railly</i> to meet him again, at a hotel in Philadelphia in two years time, and disappears right before her eyes, but not before being shot by the approaching police.</p>

                Virologist Cassandra Railly (played by Amanda Schull) at first does not believe James Cole, but she gradually comes to realise that he indeed came from the future.
            </div>

            <p>Two years later, in 2015, <i>Railly</i> hangs out in the hotel bar, fruitlessly waiting for <i>Cole</i> to arrive. She has been waiting for him here the whole week and finally decides to check out, when <i>Cole</i> stumbles in, still wounded. <i>Railly</i> takes him to her room and, as she begins to treat his wound, <i>Cole</i> passes out. When he comes round, <i>Cole</i> explains <i>Railly</i> that in the future she had worked for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - the leading national public health institute of the United States">CDC</a>, trying to contain the outbreak. He adds that they had discovered a garbled voice recording made by her which points to <i>Leland Frost</i> as the one responsible for the outbreak. <i>Railly</i> still insists that she does not know anyone by that name, but she takes <i>Cole</i> to see a retired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency (NSA) - an intelligence organization of the United States government">NSA</a> operative and a friend of her father’s, who finally has some answers. It turns out that their man is <i>Dr Leland Goines</i>, the CEO of <i>Markridge Laboratories</i>, a bioengineering firm, who has the security codename <i>‘Frost’</i>.</p>
            <p><i>Cole</i> an <i>Railly</i> bluff their way into a party with <i>Goines</i> in attendance, where <i>Cole</i> attempts to assassinate <i>Goines</i>, but <i>Railly</i>, who has qualms about killing an unarmed man, shouts out and <i>Cole</i> is subdued by security guards. The police arrest <i>Railly</i> and <i>Cole</i> and then drive them to a deserted area where they hand them over to <i>Markridge</i> security personnel, who take them to one of the company’s facilities. After <i>Goines</i> arrives to interrogate <i>Cole</i>, he says that he knows that <i>Cole</i> is a time traveller as he and <i>Cole</i> already met once before in 1987, when <i>Cole</i>, looking <i>exactly</i> the same, had been asking him about some <i>‘Army of the twelve monkeys’</i>. <i>Cole</i>, however, has no recollection of this meeting, as from the perspective of his timeline this hasn’t happened yet. He then creates a distraction by touching the two versions of <i>Railly’s</i> watch (from the present and from the future) together, creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_paradox" title="Time Paradox - logical contradiction resulting from the effects of time travel">time paradox</a> that causes first an apparent slowing down of time and then a small, but powerful explosion. Dazed <i>Goines</i> staggers out of the room, fires a gun at escaping <i>Cole</i> and <i>Railly</i>, and then collapses on the floor. <i>Cole</i> walks over, takes <i>Goines’s</i> gun, and shoots him dead.</p>

                Mentally disturbed math genius Jennifer Goines (Emily Hampshire) is visited in her cell in the psychiatric hospital by the sinister ‘Pallid Man’ (Tom Noonan).
            </div>

            <p>Upon returning to 2043, <i>Cole</i> discovers that the virus was still released and the pandemic has not been averted. He and <i>Jones</i> study an evidence wall with news clippings about the early days of the outbreak. In the background of one picture, <i>Cole</i> spots a graffiti featuring a big monkey’s head surrounded by twelve smaller monkeys and deduces that <i>Goines</i> was not alone and that others must have been involved in the release of the deadly virus. Back in 2015, <i>Goines’s</i> daughter <i>Jennifer</i> is visited in a mental institution by one of <i>Goines’s</i> employees and informed that she inherited her father’s fortune and company, the <i>Markridge Group</i>. She appears to be completely unmoved by the news, and continues frantically drawing a picture of a monkey’s head on the wall of her cell…</p>
            <p>During the course of the next twelve episodes, <i>Cole</i>, in order to try and prevent the outbreak, is sent to many places and multiple timelines, including: North Korea in 2006 (where he is arrested and tortured by military interrogators); Philadelphia in 2015 (where he finally tracks down mentally disturbed <i>Jennifer Goines</i> in the psychiatric hospital, questions her about the <i>‘Army of the 12 Monkeys’</i> and learns about the <i>‘Night Room’</i>, a top-security lab where her father carried out his most secret experiments); Haiti in 2014 (in order to interrogate <i>Dr. Henri Toussaint</i>, the only person besides <i>Jennifer Goines</i> who knows about the <i>‘Night Room’</i>); Chechnya in 2015 (where CIA plans to use the virus to cause a localised outbreak in order to eliminate <i>Adam Wexler</i>, a runaway ex-CIA analyst); Philadelphia in 2017 (where <i>Cole</i> gets stranded in a timeline where the plague is well underway, and where he visits dying <i>Railly</i>, who is spearheading the futile fight against the virus at the CDC); Tokyo in 1987 (where <i>Cole</i> tries to stop <i>Leland Goines</i> from acquiring the original specimen of the plague virus – a centuries-old human torso preserved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost" title="Permafrost a.k.a. Cryotic Soil - soil at or below the freezing point of water 0°C (32°F) for a period of two or more years">permafrost</a> – but is stabbed, almost fatally, by <i>Ramse</i> who travels here on his own to stop <i>Cole</i>, after he turns against him and <i>Jones</i>, when he realises that the stopping of the outbreak would also mean that his family is erased from the timeline); Philadelphia in 2015 (where is <i>Cole</i> sent by <i>Jones</i> in a desperate attempt to save him and where, after being found by <i>Railly</i>, he finally grasps that the person who helped the <i>‘Army of the 12 Monkeys’</i> always remain one step ahead of them, is, in fact, his best friend <i>Ramse</i> – it turns out that <i>Ramse</i> was imprisoned in Japan for 1987’s stabbing of <i>Cole</i>, but while in prison, was contacted by <i>Olivia</i>, the mysterious female member of the <i>‘Army of the 12 Monkeys’</i>, who helped him through his ordeal, and, upon his release from the jail in 1995, initiated him into their sect); all the while he is often crossing paths with the uncanny <i>‘Pallid Man’</i> of the <i>‘Army of the 12 Monkeys’</i>, paying regular visits to <i>Dr. Cassandra Railly</i> in 2015 with whom he starts to develop a relationship, and periodically returning to his timeline in 2043 to be debriefed by the head of the time-travel project <i>Katarina Jones</i>.</p>

                Enigmatic Olivia, a senior member of the ‘Army of the Twelve Monkeys’ (brilliantly portrayed by Alisen Down) seems to be always pulling strings in the background. 
            </div>

            <p>When in 2015 <i>Railly</i> finds gravelly ill <i>Cole</i> sent to her by <i>Jones</i>, she contacts the much younger version of <i>Katarina Jones</i> from her timeline and convinces her to help <i>Cole</i>, who is dying from the side effects of time travel. <i>Jones</i> says that the only thing that can help is blood from the young 2015 version of <i>Cole</i>. <i>Cole’s</i> father is at first dismissive and highly suspicious of their intentions and motivation, but when <i>Railly</i> and <i>Jones</i> bring him and young <i>James Cole</i> at the bedside of the adult, dying <i>Cole</i>, <i>Cole</i> senior, to his amazement, recognises in the dying man his, even though now mature, son, and agrees to help.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the <i>‘Army of the 12 Monkeys’</i> is also after <i>Cole</i> and converges on the building. While <i>Cole’s</i> father dies defending the younger version of his son from the <i>‘Pallid Man’</i>, adult <i>Cole</i> injects himself with the blood sample, causing a time paradox that cures him and causes an explosion that scares off the sect. 2015 version of <i>Jones</i> then informs grown-up <i>Cole</i> that he no longer has the ability to travel through time and is forever stuck in this timeline.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile, mentally-unstable <i>Jennifer</i> stages a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover#Hostile_takeovers" title="Hostile Takeover - taking over a company whose management is unwilling to agree to a merger or takeover">hostile takeover</a> of the <i>Markridge Group</i> and installs herself as the new CEO, while 2043 version of <i>Jones</i> is attempting to restart the time-travel project, when a group of twelve mysterious hooded figures, led by <i>Deacon</i>, the leader of <i>‘West VII’</i>, assault the <i>Temporal Facility</i> housing the time machine.</p>
            <p>In 2015, <i>Cole</i> and <i>Railly</i> break into <i>Raritan National Laboratories</i>, which house the prototype of the time machine, where they come face-to-face with <i>Ramse</i>, who also plans to use the time machine in order to return to 2043. In an ensuing shootout, both <i>Railly</i> and <i>Ramse</i> are seriously injured. <i>Cole</i> uses <i>Ramse’s</i> supply of the time-travel serum to send <i>Railly</i> to 2043, in a hope that <i>Jones</i> will be able to save her, and helps the less-gravely wounded <i>Ramse</i> to escape the facility.</p>

                The season’s finale sees the mysterious group of twelve cloaked characters, presumably the ‘Army of the Twelve Monkeys’, assaulting the Temporal Facility. 
            </div>

            <p>The season’s cliffhanger sees <i>Olivia</i> inspecting 12 newborn infants, preparing them to be ready in 28-years-time for the sect’s plans, while <i>Jennifer</i> is embarking on a plane trip, seemingly to spread the plague virus around the world. Meantime in 2043, <i>Deacon</i>, and the mysterious group of twelve, seize the control of the time machine, just as badly injured <i>Railly</i> arrives from 2015…</p>
            <p><i>12 Monkeys</i> definitely has its bright moments, but the series ultimately fails to re-capture the magic of the 1995 film. Even though it is hard to put a finger on just what exactly went wrong, one of the factors could be the (presumed) low budget of the series, causing the overuse of the show’s sets. Whereas one can understand that the production companies want good value for money on their substantial financial investment, there <i>does</i> seem to be a rather disproportionate amount of time spent on just two sets: <i>Dr. Railly’s</i> grandparents’ old bookstore, and the room in the <i>Temporal Facility</i> housing the time machine (and can somebody please explain me why is someone constantly <i>welding</i> in the latter ???).</p>
            <p>Another factor could be bad casting of the main characters – in particular two of them: <i>Aaron Stanford</i> may be a good-looking bloke, but he unfortunately lacks the male lead’s charisma of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis" title="Walter Bruce Willis, American actor starring as James Cole in the original '12 Monkeys' film">Bruce Willis</a>, while <i>Barbara Sukowa</i> is unconvincing as the head of the time-travel project.</p>

            <div class="picture_score_right">
				<a href="review_policy.html"><img src="images/score-6.png" alt="" title="" /></a>
			</div>

            <p>Luckily, these miscasts are partially redeemed by strong performances of the supporting cast, so even though <i>Aaron Stanford</i> comes across as rather underwhelming rendition of <i>James Cole</i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Noonan" title="Tom Noonan, American film and television actor">Tom Noonan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisen_Down" title="Alisen Elizabeth Jean Down, Canadian film and television actress">Alisen Down</a> excel as the wonderfully sinister <i>‘Pallid Man’</i>, and enigmatic <i>Olivia</i> of the <i>Army of the Twelve Monkeys</i>, respectively. One can but hope that these characters will get more exposure as the series develops.</p>           

            <p><i>12 Monkeys</i> was renewed for a second season, returning in spring 2016.</p>
