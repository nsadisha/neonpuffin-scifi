            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics" title="Marvel Comics - publisher of comic books and related media, subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company">Marvel Comics</a> announced, to a big excitement of the overjoyed fans of the <i>Alien</i> franchise, that all-new limited comic book series set in the iconic – and deeply terrifying – world of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(creature_in_Alien_franchise)" title="Xenomorph a.k.a. Alien - fictional endoparasitoid extraterrestrial species and the main antagonist of the 'Alien' film series">Xenomorph</a> would be launching at some point during 2021. Now, <i>Marvel</i> further clarified that the first of these forays into never-before-seen dark corners of the <i>Alien</i> universe will begin in March 2021 with <b>ALIEN #1</b>.</p>                        
            <p>Written by <a href="https://www.dccomics.com/talent/phillip-kennedy-johnson" title="Phillip Kennedy Johnson, American comic book writer">Phillip Kennedy Johnson</a> (<i>Empyre: Captain America</i>) with art by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Larroca" title="Salvador Larroca,  Spanish comic book artist">Salvador Larroca</a> (<i>Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men</i>), <i>ALIEN #1</i> will be a thrilling addition to the now legendary <i>Alien</i> universe spanning all genres and beginning with the ground-breaking 1979 science fiction horror film by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott, English film director and producer, best known for his science fiction films Alien and Blade Runner">Ridley Scott</a>. Featuring both canon-based and brand-new characters from Earth and beyond, this new bold take on the <i>Alien</i> mythology aims to entertain both seasoned fans and complete newcomers to the legendary horror science fiction saga alike.</p>

            <p>The miniseries' new story arc will feature a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise)#Premise" title="Weyland-Yutani Corp - unscrupulous megacorporation central to the Alien franchise">Weyland-Yutani</a> mercenary named <i>Gabriel Cruz</i> as he battles a deadly new breed of <i>Xenomorph</i> with the survival of his child at stake. No stranger to infusing the classic <i>Marvel</i> storytelling with horror, the series writer <i>Phillip Kennedy Johnson</i> most recently scared his readers senseless in the terrifying <i>‘Marvel Zombies: Resurrection’</i> series.</p>

                    <i>and with my talented friends at Marvel and some of the greatest artists in comics telling these stories with me, <br>I can promise you: our nightmares will be also yours</i> - says comic artist Salvador Larroca

            </blockquote>

            <p><i>“Just as a reader and fan, I was as excited as anyone when I heard the [Alien] franchise was coming to Marvel, and when they asked me to write the launch [issue], I was floored. I’ve been training my whole life for this gig without knowing it.”</i> Johnson says, before adding: <i>“Ever since seeing Ridley Scott’s Alien at way too young an age, I’ve been obsessed with the Xenomorph – the single most iconic representation of terror on film.”</i></p>                        
            <p><i>“Drawing this has been like a dream come true, and I am so grateful to be a part of this series.”</i> says comic's artist <i>Salvador Larroca</i> and then continues: <i>“Ever since I was young, Alien has been one of my favourite sci-fi horror franchises, and I never could have expected to have the chance to draw this. Alien is a creative reference to a whole generation of artists, and I’m so proud to now be illustrating this series. I hope readers enjoy it as much as I do drawing it.”</i></p>

            </div>

            <p>Larroca then concludes by saying: <i>“I’ve devoured every Alien story I could find in every imaginable medium available and spent a lot of hours in the back of a classroom sketching out ideas for what happened before, after, and in-between the chapters we got to see in the movies. Now, aided by  Phillip Kennedy Johnson's awesome storytelling, I finally have the opportunity to bring my favourite nightmares to life. And, with my insanely talented friends at Marvel and some of the greatest artists in comics telling these stories with me, I can promise you: our nightmares will be yours.”</i></p>
