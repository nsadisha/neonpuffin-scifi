            <div id="draw_title_header_black_background">Star Wars: Rogue One will be the first Star Wars spin-off film</div>

            <p>The title of the first <i>Star Wars spin-off film</i> will be <i>‘Rogue One’</i> it has been announced by <i>Disney</i> chairman and CEO <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger" title="Robert Allen 'Bob' Iger, American businessman and the chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company">Bob Iger</a> at a shareholders meeting at the <i>Palace of Fine Arts</i> in San Francisco on 12 March 2015.</p>
            <p><i>Rogue One</i> is the first film in a planned series of stand-alone features that will explore the characters and events of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe beyond the core <i>Star Wars</i> saga. The film will be directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Edwards_%28director%29" title="Gareth Edwards, English film director, screenwriter and visual effects artist">Gareth Edwards</a> (<i>Monsters, Godzilla</i>) with script by Oscar nominee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Weitz#Other_projects" title="Christopher John 'Chris' Weitz, American film producer, director, screenwriter and actor">Chris Weitz</a>.</p>
            <p>The first actress cast for the <i>Star Wars</i> spin-off film is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicity_Jones" title="Felicity Rose Hadley Jones, English actress">Felicity Jones</a>, although no details have been released as yet on the character to be played by <i>‘The Theory of Everything’</i> star.</p>

                'Star Wars: Rogue One' will be helmed by the director of 'Godzilla' Gareth Edwards (top) and will star Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones (bottom) in yet unconfirmed role.
            </div>

            <p>Little is known about the storyline of the movie, other than that the idea for the <i>Rogue One</i> came from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knoll" title="John Knoll, visual effects supervisor and chief creative officer at Industrial Light & Magic">John Knoll</a>, an Academy Award-winning visual effects supervisor and chief creative officer at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic" title="Industrial Light & Magic, American motion picture visual effects company founded by George Lucas">Industrial Light & Magic</a>.</p>
            <p>At the same meeting, film director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rian_Johnson" title="Rian Johnson, American film screenwriter, director and producer">Rian Johnson</a> (<i>Looper</i>) has been confirmed to direct <i>Star Wars Episode VIII</i>.</p>
            <p>Stand-alone <i>Star Wars</i> films were in the works ever since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company, multinational mass media corporation headquartered in California, USA">The Walt Disney Company</a> acquired <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm" title="Lucasfilm Limited, LLC, American film and television production company">Lucasfilm</a> back in 2012. Originally, three spin-off films were announced, with plans to release them in years between <i>Star Wars: Episodes VII, VIII, and IX</i>, though later only two stand-alone films were confirmed, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan" title="Lawrence Edward Kasdan, American film screenwriter, director and producer">Lawrence Kasdan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Kinberg" title="Simon Kinberg, American film screenwriter and producer">Simon Kinberg</a> earmarked to co-write the screenplays.</p>
            <p>Close to nothing is known about these stand-alone <i>Star Wars</i> films, but rumours are abound that the first and the second spin-off film will feature <i>Han Solo</i> and <i>Boba Fett</i> respectively, especially after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rasulo" title="James A. 'Jay' Rasulo, Senior Executive VP and CFO of the The Walt Disney Company">Jay Rasulo</a>, <i>Disney</i> CFO, has described the stand-alone films as <i>'origin stories'</i>.</p>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_%28film_producer%29" title="Kathleen Kennedy, American film producer and president of Lucasfilm">Kathleen Kennedy</a>, the president of <i>Lucasfilm</i> and the brand manager of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise since <i>The Walt Disney Company</i> acquired the studio, said earlier that the stand-alone films will not crossover with the <i>‘core’</i> films of the series (<i>Star Wars: Episode I – IX</i>), stating, <i>"George [Lucas] was so clear as to how that works. The canon that he created was the Star Wars saga. Right now, Episode VII falls within that canon. The spin-off movies, or we may come up with some other way to call those films, they exist within that vast universe that he created. There is no attempt being made to carry characters in and out of the saga episodes. Consequently, from the creative standpoint, it's a roadmap that George made pretty clear."</i></p>

            <br/>

            <p><i>Star Wars: Rogue One</i> starts shooting in summer of 2015 in London and is scheduled for theatrical release on 16 December 2016.</p>
