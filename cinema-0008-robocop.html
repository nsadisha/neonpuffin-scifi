            <p>The year is 2028 and a multinational corporation <i>OmniCorp</i> is at the centre point of advanced robot technology. Their battle robots have been used by the military in the overseas conflicts for some time now - and it made <i>OmniCorp</i> and its <i>CEO Raymond Sellars</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keaton" title="American actor Michael Keaton">Michael Keaton</a>) rich beyond imagination. However, when <i>OmniCorp</i> wants to expand the business by selling their robots for use in the civilian law enforcement at the home front, this is met with stiff opposition from the public. The U.S. Senate, swayed by the public opinion, comes up with the <i>Dreyfus Act</i> - a law forbidding the use of armed robots on US soil.</p>

                In an attempt on his life, Alex Murphy sustained horrendous injuries which could mean the end of his career…
            </div>

            <p><i>Sellars</i> and his team desperately try to come up with some PR spin to change the public opinion, and at last come up with a cunning ploy to sell their vision of machines in law enforcement to the general public. They realise that the root cause of public distrust in <i>OmniCorp’s</i> robots is their non-human nature and decide to give their product a human face.</p>

                …if there wasn’t for OmniCorp's Dr. Dennett Norton, who gives him a cybernetic body, in many aspects better than his old, human one.
            </div>
                        
            <p>To this end, <i>Sellars</i> instructs his chief scientist <i>Dr. Dennett Norton</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman" title="English screen and stage actor Gary Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>) to find the right candidate for his plan. An opportunity soon comes in the form of <i>Alex Murphy</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kinnaman" title="Swedish actor Charles Joel Nordstrom aka Joel Kinnaman">Joel Kinnaman</a>) - a good cop, husband and father who is critically injured in the line of duty. Using a robotic body and software from their line of military robots and the latest breakthroughs in the brain-computer interface, <i>OmniCorp</i> builds a perfect cybernetic police officer – a law enforcer with the reaction times of a machine but appearances and emotions of a human being.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_black align_left" style="text-align: left; width: 892px; margin-bottom:8px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->
                <img src="images_cinema/cinema0008-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid white;" />
                Initially, Murphy’s reaction times are worse than those of his fully-robotic counterparts, but after some adjustments to his brain-computer interface, these improve.
            </div>

            <p>While uploading the whole police database, including footage from all CCTV cameras in Detroit, into <i>Murphy’s</i> brain, he is emotionally overwhelmed and has a major seizure. So that he doesn’t ruin the impending public press conference, <i>Dr. Norton</i> alters <i>Murphy’s</i> brain chemistry, lowering his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine" title="Hormone and neurotransmitter dopamine">dopamine</a> levels until he no longer displays any emotions. <i>Murphy</i> attends the press conference, where he passes by his waiting wife and son - completely ignoring them, but efficiently apprehends a wanted criminal standing in the crowd in a direct view of dozens of policemen who are utterly oblivious to his presence.</p>
            <p><i>Sellars</i>, with a substantial help of the influential news-show host <i>Pat Novak</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson" title="American actor Samuel L. Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>) - the one who coins <i>Murphy’s</i> new nickname <i>‘RoboCop’</i>, spins this incident into a massive PR success. And as <i>RoboCop’s</i> presence on the streets of Detroit drastically reduces the crime in the city, the public opinion on the <i>Dreyfus Act</i> begins to turn.</p>

                Despite his life-changing injuries, Alex remains a devoted husband and father.
            </div>

            <p><i>Clara, Murphy’s</i> wife, manages to confront her husband as he is leaving the police station, telling him about the nightmares experienced by their son, <i>David</i>. <i>Murphy</i> seemingly ignores <i>Clara</i> again, but then overrides his crime-fighting software by giving the highest priority to solving his own case. He replays and analyses the video footage from CCTV cameras at his home at the time of his injury and comes to the conclusion that it was seeing his mutilated body after the car explosion, from the window of his upstairs room, that left his son <i>David</i> traumatised. This experience also raises <i>Murphy’s</i> dopamine levels back to normal, thus reviving his lost emotions and feelings towards his family.</p>

                OmniCorp succeeds in creating a perfect cybernetic law enforcer with the reaction times of a robot and experiences of a qualified police officer – RoboCop…
            </div>

            <p><i>Murphy</i> puts the solving of his assassination attempt on the top of the list in his database of unsolved crimes and gradually begins to unravel the whole criminal organization involved in the attempt on his life, all the way up to the corrupt members of the <i>Detroit police department</i>. But when he is about to arrest the <i>Chief of Police</i>, his luck runs out as <i>Rick Mattox</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Earle_Haley" title="American actor Jackie Earle Haley">Jackie Earle Haley</a>) - <i>Sellars’s</i> automated military tactical expert who follows <i>Murphy’s</i> actions via the camera in his visor, realises that <i>Murphy</i> went too far this time and intervenes, shutting him down by a remote control and having him taken back to the <i>OmniCorp’s</i> laboratory.</p>

                …who soon unravels the whole criminal organization all the way up to the corrupt highly-ranked officers of the Detroit police department.
            </div>

            <p><i>Sellars</i> once again spins this unexpected turn of the events to his advantage via the news-show <i>The Novak Element</i>, where its host <i>Pat Novak</i> points out that the robot policemen, as opposed to human ones, are incorruptible. As a consequence, the public opinion shifts dramatically in <i>OmniCorp's</i> favour, and the repeal of the <i>Dreyfus Act</i> goes underway with votes overwhelmingly in support of the repeal.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_black align_left" style="text-align: left; width: 892px; margin-bottom:8px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->

                Samuel L. Jackson steals the show with his portrayal of a highly-articulate television news show host Pat Novak.
            </div>

            <p>In the meantime, <i>Sellars</i> concludes that an android who can override his own program could seriously endanger his plans and decides that <i>RoboCop</i> should be terminated.  He orders <i>Mattox</i> to dispose of <i>Murphy</i>. However, <i>Dr. Norton</i> reaches the lab first and revives <i>Murphy</i>, telling him everything. <i>Murphy</i>, feeling betrayed, seeks <i>Sellars</i> for the final confrontation…</p>

            <p>Brought right up-to-date with its setting, storyline, and, naturally, some high-quality CGI trickery, and backed by the solid performances of the cast, <i>RoboCop</i> is a worthy update of the classic futuristic thriller. But it is <i>Samuel L. Jackson</i> in his portrayal of the news-show presenter <i>Pat Novak</i> who completely steals the show.</p>
