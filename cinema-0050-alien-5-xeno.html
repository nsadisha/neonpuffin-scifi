            <p class="shift_paragraph_up">Ever since the last member of the audience left the cinema after the curtains came down on <i>Alien: Resurrection</i>, the die-hard fans of the franchise were asking questions: <i>“What’s next?”</i>, <i>“Is this the end of the Alien saga?”</i> and <i>“Will there be another sequel?”</i></p>

            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver" title="Sigourney Weaver, American actress">Sigourney Weaver</a>, whose participation was considered to be instrumental for any direct sequel, has remained open to a role in a fifth instalment – on the condition that she likes the story.</p>
            <p>Film director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon" title="Joseph Hill 'Joss' Whedon, American film and television screenwriter, director and producer">Joss Whedon</a> (of <i>‘Firefly’</i> fame) had even written an Earth-set script for <i>Alien 5</i>, but <i>Weaver</i> was not interested in this setting, and sought to return the story to the planetoid from the first <i>Alien</i> film.</p>
            <p>Another film director, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Francis Cameron, Canadian film screenwriter, director and producer">James Cameron</a> (who directed <i>‘Aliens’</i> – the second instalment of the <i>Alien</i> franchise) expressed an interest in writing the script for a fifth <i>Alien</i> film, but learning of <i>20th Century Fox’s</i> plans for a crossover <i>‘Alien vs. Predator’</i>, he ceased work on his screenplay, saying that it would <i>“kill the validity of the franchise”</i>, and that it was <i>“Frankenstein meets Werewolf – like Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other”</i>. After this, <i>Cameron</i> ruled out any future involvement with the series.</p>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott, English film director and producer">Ridley Scott</a>, who created the <i>Alien</i> universe, was also playing with the idea of returning to the franchise and as far back as 2002 stated that a new <i>Alien</i> project <i>“would be a lot of fun”</i>, but that <i>“the most important thing was to get the story right”</i>. However, <i>Scott</i> later ditched the idea of the sequel and instead started working on a prequel that explained the origin of the <i>‘Space Jockey’</i> alien race of giants (later called <i>‘Engineers’</i>) whose skeleton was found in the derelict spacecraft in the first <i>Alien</i> film. The film, titled <i>Prometheus</i>, was released in 2012 by the <i>20th Century Fox</i>.</p>          
            <p>With <i>Ridley Scott</i> starting a new, relatively successful prequel spin-off series (with the second instalment titled <i>‘Prometheus: Paradise’</i>, already in the development), the likelihood of another <i>Alien</i> sequel seemed to be pretty slim.</p>
            <p>As recently as 2014, <i>Sigourney Weaver</i> hinted that she was still interested in returning to the role of <i>Ellen Ripley</i>, adding that the ending to <i>‘Alien: Resurrection’</i> <i>“feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn’t, but it does. We left it hanging. And there’s a way to finish this story that I think would be satisfying to me and the many fans.”</i> – but there wasn’t any film director worthy of the highly-coveted franchise who would be willing to pick up the baton. Or was there?</p>

            <blockquote class="white" style="max-width: 250px; float: right;">
                <span>
                   Um... So I think it’s officially my next film. #alien - Neill Blomkamp posting on Instagram
                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The hopes of <i>Alien</i> fans were reinvigorated, and then dashed, once more, when the <a href="#slideshow" title="Concept Art for Alien 5 - Xeno by Geoffroy Thoorens">Concept Art</a> of an <i>Alien</i> sequel posted by director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neill_Blomkamp" title="Neill Blomkamp, South African–Canadian film and advertisement screenwriter, director and producer">Neill Blomkamp</a> on his Instagram profile on 2nd January 2015 raised speculations to the possibility of a new <i>Alien</i> film being made under his direction. However, <i>Blomkamp</i> wrote under the images: <i>“Was working on this. Don’t think I am anymore. Love it though.”</i> and <i>“Woulda rocked. Was a mental stroll into the world Ridley Scott created.”</i>.</p>
            <p>So that is that right? Fortunately, there was yet another twist to the story, for on 18th February 2015, <i>Blomkamp</i> posted: <i>“Um... So I think it’s officially my next film. #alien”</i>, alongside the original artwork of the <i>Alien Xenomorph</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger" title="Hans Rudolf 'Ruedi' Giger, Swiss surrealist painter, sculptor and film set designer">H. R. Giger</a>.</p>
            <p><b>So these are the facts:</b> There <i>will be</i> a new <i>Alien</i> film that will be <i>distinct</i> from the <i>Prometheus</i> franchise, starring (<i>very likely</i>) <i>Sigourney Weaver</i> (she confirmed that she would be happy to reprise her role as <i>Ellen Ripley</i> in a new <i>Alien</i> film under <i>Blomkamp’s</i> direction), directed by <i>Neill Blomkamp</i>, with <i>Ridley Scott</i> returning as a producer via his production company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Free_Productions" title="Scott Free Productions, film and television production company founded by brothers filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott">Scott Free Productions</a>. It has been also confirmed that the storyline will take place some years <i>after</i> the planned <i>Prometheus</i> sequel (naturally, as <i>Prometheus</i> is a <i>prequel</i> to <i>Alien</i>). The name of the movie has yet to be announced, however, one of the artworks posted by <i>Blomkamp</i> bore a title: <i>“Alien Xeno”</i>.</p>

                Inside the Weyland-Yutani Corporation headquarters, where research is underway on the derelict Engineers’ Spacecraft.
            </div>

            <p><b>The following is pure speculation</b> (though speculation based on the known facts and the <a href="#slideshow" title="Concept Art for Alien 5 - Xeno by Geoffroy Thoorens">Concept Art</a> released by <i>Blomkamp</i>):</p>
            <p><b><i>The likely storyline of Alien 5 will be as follows:</i></b></p>
            <p><i>Weyland-Yutani operatives return to Planetoid LV-426, retrieve the derelict alien spacecraft and transport it to Weyland-Yutani Corporation headquarters, located on Earth or another planet, for the extraction of Alien Eggs and further examination of the craft. Needles to say, it doesn’t take too long and things go awry. The Aliens, bred by the corporation for military use, break free from their confinement and run rampant throughout the facility. When everything seems to be lost, plucky Ellen Ripley (possibly accompanied by Dwayne Hicks) steps in, exterminates the Xenomorphs, and saves the day.</i></p>
            <p>But <i>Corporal Dwayne Hicks</i> has died at the beginning of <i>Alien 3</i> !!! (<i>I can hear you shouting</i>). But has he really ??? (<i>I answer to that</i>).</p>
            <p>It is a well known fact that such a trifling thing as the death of the main protagonist never stopped film studios from bringing them back (<i>’resurrection’</i> of <i>Ellen Ripley</i> by means of cloning in <i>‘Alien: Resurrection’</i> being a good example of this).</p>
            <p>The released <a href="#slideshow" title="Concept Art for Alien 5 - Xeno by Geoffroy Thoorens">Concept Art</a> features aged <i>Warrant Officer Ripley</i> alongside now older, heavily scarred <i>Corporal Hicks</i> as portrayed in <i>Aliens</i> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Biehn" title="Michael Connell Biehn, American actor">Michael Biehn</a>, so the possibility remains that <i>Blomkamp</i> found a way of bringing him back, possibly also as a clone.</p>
            <p>Three of the nine images released by <i>Blomkamp</i> feature present-day <i>Sigourney Weaver</i> as <i>Ellen Ripley</i> (particularly intriguing is the picture showing <i>Ripley/Weaver</i> wearing an alien-technology suit including a helmet, inscribed <i>“Pilot M[odel]? / Space Jockey”</i> – even though it looks much more like a <i>‘Xenomorph disguise kit’</i>, haha), so her return in <i>Blomkamp’s Alien</i> is highly likely, especially in the light of the revelation that <i>Blomkamp</i> worked on the project with <i>Weaver</i> during downtimes from his latest sci-fi movie <i>Chappie</i> (which features the former <i>Alien</i> star).</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_black align_left" style="text-align: left; max-width: 902px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->

                It’s only a matter of time before the Alien Queen breaks free from her confinement and starts wreaking havoc on the facility.
            </div>

            <p>The <a href="#slideshow" title="Concept Art for Alien 5 - Xeno by Geoffroy Thoorens">Concept Art</a> also seems to suggest that the <i>Alien Eggs</i> will return to the original <i>H. R. Giger’s</i> <i>‘slit’</i> opening design (as opposed to the <i>‘cross’</i> opening design used in <i>Ridley Scott’s Alien</i> and all subsequent <i>Alien</i> sequels and spin-offs). <i>H. R. Giger’s</i> design was not used in the original <i>Alien</i> film as it was deemed too risque, resembling (and <i>indeed</i> modelled on) female genitalia.</p>
            <p><i>Ripley’s</i> return is far more straightforward than <i>Hicks’s</i>, as she is still alive (sort of) in the <i>Alien</i> universe, and was last seen as a human-xenomorph hybrid <i>‘Ripley Clone 8’</i> in the film <i>‘Alien: Resurrection’</i>, after the original <i>Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley</i> died by throwing herself into a gigantic furnace at the end of <i>Alien 3</i>, having sacrificed herself in order to kill the <i>Alien Queen</i> gestating inside her.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>The first, most obvious option</b> is to bring <i>Ripley</i> back either as the former <i>‘Ripley Clone 8’</i> (who didn’t die at the end of <i>Alien: Resurrection</i>) or yet another clone of the original <i>Ellen Ripley</i>, and pick up the story where it left off at the end of the last film.</li>
                <li style="margin-top:10px;"><b>The second option</b> is that <i>Blomkamp</i> will completely disregard some previous films, or their parts. For instance <i>‘pretending’</i> that <i>Alien 3</i> and <i>Alien: Resurrection</i> did not happen (some fans of the <i>Alien</i> franchise wish <i>that they didn’t</i>) would not only allow for <i>Ripley’s</i> return, but also open up a possibility of <i>Michael Biehn</i> reprising his role as <i>Corporal Dwayne Hicks</i> (the <i>Concept Art</i> posted by <i>Blomkamp</i> may suggest that this is the case). This scenario is however rather messy (as it would completely break up the chronology of the series) and therefore unlikely.</li>
                <li style="margin-top:10px;"><b>The third option</b> is a complete, clear-cut reboot of the <i>Alien</i> franchise. However, this option is also quite improbable, as such a move wouldn’t likely go down well with the fans of the franchise, let alone with <i>Ridley Scott</i>, or allow for <i>Sigourney Weaver’s</i> return, save for a possible cameo appearance.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <p><b>There is also another option though</b> – the released <i>Concept Art</i> is a red herring and all the pictures belong to an old version of the script which has been since abandoned by the director or rejected by the studio. (This would explain why <i>Blomkamp</i> released material that could potentially reveal the plot of the movie and thus spoil the viewing experience – the posted pictures may bear no relevance to the planned film).</p>
            <p>Whichever scenario he goes for, <i>Neill Blomkamp</i> is no stranger to science fiction. In fact, his entire directing career so far has revolved only around sci-fi genre. His breakout film, 2009’s <i>‘District 9’</i> was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Visual Effects. This was followed by 2013’s dystopian science fiction thriller <i>‘Elysium’</i> and 2015’s science fiction film <i>‘Chappie’</i>.</p>
            <p>The legacy of the <i>Alien</i> franchise appears to be in safe hands.</p>
            <p><i>Alien: Xeno</i> (if that will be the title) will be distributed by the <i>20th Century Fox</i>, with a tentative release date 4 March 2016.</p>
