            <p>ritten by <i>Michael Moreci</i> and illustrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_McDaid" title="Dan McDaid, British comic book writer and artist">Dan McDaid</a>, <i>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</i> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom!_Studios" title="Boom! Studios - American comic book and graphic novel publisher, headquartered in Los Angeles, California">Boom! Studios’</a> 6-issue comic miniseries that expands the now legendary world of the <i>Planet of the Apes</i>, in the process dealing with the classic and archetypal questions of the post-apocalyptic subgenre, such as: what does it mean being human, what is the true function of society and civilization, and whether being civilised is even possible in the unforgiving post-apocalyptic world.</p>

            <p>Bridging the 10-year gap between the <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i> and <a href="cinema-0014-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes.html" title="Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - review of the science fiction film">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a> films, the miniseries charts the fall of humanity and the rise of <i>Caesar’s</i> civilization. The narrative of the comic toggles between two separate storylines: While the apes of the world have yet to evolve as a fully intelligent species, <i>Caesar</i> is trying to find a way to unify them to one cause. On the other side of the country, <i>Malcolm</i> ventures into the slowly disintegrating Americas with his wife <i>Rita</i> and son <i>Alex</i>, struggling to protect them from other survivors who have grouped into lawless, marauding gangs, prowling the countryside and rummaging through abandoned houses for anything edible or usable. World powers will shift as one civilization, that of the humans, collapses, slowly giving way to a new one – civilization of apes.</p>
            <p>The first storyline, that centres on <i>Malcolm</i> and his family, describes how <i>Rita</i>, who becomes infected with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic Engineering (a.k.a. Genetic Modification) - direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology to produce improved or new organisms">genetically engineered</a> virus <i>ALZ-113</i> a.k.a. <i>Simian Flu</i>, is trying to hide her quickly deteriorating condition from her husband <i>Malcolm</i> and their son <i>Alex</i>. When <i>Malcolm</i> eventually finds out, <i>Rita</i> pleads with him to leave her behind so he and <i>Alex</i> may be safe, but he refuses to abandon her and they instead set out on a perilous journey with the aim to reach a medical research facility in Austin, rumoured to have a cure for the disease. On their way, they come into conflict with other survivors that are doing whatever it takes to stay alive in this harsh post-apocalyptic world, until they come across one bigger, better organised group led by a man called <i>Shavers</i>, where they find a temporary refuge. <i>Shavers</i> is trying to enlist <i>Malcolm’s</i> help in building a viable community and offers him a permanent home in their compound in return for becoming a sort of ‘resident engineer’. <i>Malcolm</i> refuses, as he wants to continue on his quest to find a cure for his sick wife. However, before they can resume their journey, the camp is attacked by human traffickers who abduct <i>Alex</i>. <i>Shavers</i> promises <i>Malcolm</i> to save his son from traffickers’ lock-up located on a ship, under the condition that he stays and helps them with their cause. The traffickers are defeated and <i>Alex</i> is freed, but <i>Malcolm</i> finally loses his gravely ill wife, who, not wanting to be a burden to her family, walks out into the night never to be seen again.</p>

            <p>The second storyline in the meantime tells the story of <i>Caesar’s</i> group of sapient apes, who are slowly starting to lay the foundations of a new civilisation – civilization of simians. Even as new parents <i>Rocket</i> and <i>Tinker</i> celebrate the birth of their son <i>Ash</i>, and <i>Caesar</i> begins to think about more distant future for his fledgling colony, the group sees a rise of a new dominant male – <i>Pope</i>. His recklessness and frequent fights with other males concern <i>Caesar</i> who instructs his right hand, <i>Coba</i>, to send <i>Pope</i> on an exploratory mission to keep him occupied. Not long after departing, <i>Pope</i> and his band come upon an abandoned Zoo, with a resident population of a couple of dozen natural, unaltered apes. <i>Pope</i> confronts, and, using his superior intelligence, easily defeats, their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_%28ethology%29" title="Alpha - the highest ranking individual in a group of social animals">Alpha male</a> and takes over the remaining apes with the intention to build a personal army to try and challenge <i>Caesar’s</i> leadership. While most of the sapient apes in the forward party are bullied by <i>Pope</i> into obedience, two – <i>Cora</i> and <i>Fifer</i>, remain loyal to <i>Caesar</i> and set off to warn him. Just as they are departing, they are ambushed by <i>Pope</i>, who attacks <i>Cora</i>, preventing him from leaving, and spears <i>Fifer</i>, who however manages to climb on the horse’s back and flee. Badly injured <i>Fifer</i> makes it back to apes’ settlement where he warns <i>Caesar</i>, who dispatches <i>Coba</i>, and few others, to deal with the disobedient ape. <i>Coba</i> reaches the Zoo and challenges <i>Pope</i> to a fight. The two dominant males engage in an even fight that <i>Coba</i> very nearly loses, but eventually wins, spurred by the way <i>Pope</i> treats unaltered apes (calling them <i>“dumb animals”</i> just as <i>Coba</i> was called by his former human tormentors). Defeated <i>Pope</i> mocks his vanquisher, telling <i>Coba</i> that he is exactly like <i>Caesar</i>, and therefore unable to kill him (referring to <i>Caesar’s</i> avowal that <i>“apes not kill apes”</i>). <i>Coba</i> replies that he is neither like humans nor like <i>Caesar</i> (<i>“Coba is Coba”</i>), kills <i>Pope</i>, frees all the enslaved ‘natural’ apes and banished those who betrayed <i>Caesar</i>.</p>

            <p>The <i>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</i> comic book miniseries does a fairly good job of expanding the <i>Planet of the Apes</i> universe, alas, one cannot help but feel that the rather compelling narrative and intriguing set of new characters are slightly let down by some under-average illustrations.</p>
