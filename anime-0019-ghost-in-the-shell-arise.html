                The members of the <i>Public Security Section 9</i>, from left to right: <i>Borma, Saito, Batou, Major Motoko Kusanagi, Lt. Col. Daisuke Aramaki, Togusa, Ishikawa</i> and <i>Paz</i>.
            </div>

            <p>In the year 2027, when cybernetic augmentations became a norm, two-years-younger <i>Major Motoko Kusanagi</i> (main protagonist of the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> series) arrives in <i>Newport City</i>, a fictional Japanese metropolis. This being prior the formation of the <i>Public Security Section 9</i> she will be later intrinsically associated with, <i>Kusanagi</i> is still a member of the <i>Organization 501</i>, a special military unit that employs advanced cybernetic techniques in order to expose and neutralise enemy threats. The <i>Organization 501</i> is also de facto the legal owner of <i>Kusanagi’s</i> cybernetic body, which is lent to her in exchange for her services to the organization.</p>            
            <p><b>Border 1: Ghost Pain</b>, sees a senior officer, <i>Lieutenant Colonel Kurtz</i>, assigning <i>Major Kusanagi</i> to a case involving a self-propelled bomb in the shape of a cute, innocuously-looking android girl, that sets of in one of the city’s alleys, killing a major weapons dealer. Along the way, we are introduced to buxom <i>Kurutsu</i>, the head of the Army’s <i>Organization 501</i>, as well as <i>Daisuke Aramaki</i>, Chief Executive Director of <i>Public Security</i>, along with other future members of the <i>Section 9</i>: detective <i>Togusa</i>, investigator <i>Paz</i>, ex-ranger <i>Batou</i>, and explosives specialist <i>Borma</i>, who all assist <i>Kusanagi</i> with her investigation. Throughout the investigation, <i>Kusanagi</i> suffers from memory loss that inhibits her progress on the case. It is later revealed that this is a side-effect of a failed <i>‘Ghost Hack’</i>, she had performed on money-laundering conspirator <i>Mamuro</i>, during which she was infected with a memory-loss virus. Once <i>Kusanagi</i> realises that the <i>Organization 501</i> was involved in the scandal, she leaves the unit and secures legal possession of her cybernetic body. Encouraged by <i>Aramaki</i>, <i>Major Motoko Kusanagi</i> then oversees the formation of a new unit within the <i>Public Security</i>, unit which later becomes known as the <i>Section 9</i>.</p>

                Ghost in the Shell: Arise takes place in Newport City, a fictional Japanese metropolis, in the year 2027, when cybernetic augmentations became a norm.

            <p><b>Border 2: Ghost Whispers</b>, tells the story of <i>Kazuya Soga</i>, a former soldier who is being tried for crimes against humanity by the Japanese government. The alleged crime took place when <i>Soga</i> was in charge of a refugee transport and dozens of, seemingly unarmed, civilians were massacred during this operation. But nothing is quite as it seems and, after the <i>Kusanagi</i> invades <i>Soga’s</i> cyberspace, she discovers that he was affected by a memory-falsification virus. It soon becomes apparent that Soga is innocent and a victim of a false memory implant, and that the ‘unarmed civilians’ were in fact armed insurgents attempting to ambush and gun down <i>Soga</i> and his team. Also, someone hacks the <i>Logicoma</i> (<i>Logistics Conveyer Machine</i>) – an AI-equipped robotic weapons platform with a quadrupedal exoskeleton used by the <i>Public Security Section 9</i> as a bodyguard during the investigations. The Major also continues recruiting new members for the <i>Section 9</i>, such as ace sniper <i>Saito</i>, who however frequently changes sides, working for whoever offers the highest pay.</p>
            <p><b>Border 3: Ghost Tears</b>, centres on Major’s, ultimately doomed, romantic relationship with <i>Akira Hose</i>, who is not only her love interest, but her mechanic as well, all the while she and <i>Batou</i> try to stop the bombing campaign conducted by an unknown terrorist organization. Soon, they discover a clue to the origin of the terrorists in the form of the tattoos that each of the terrorists are marked with. It is the sign for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla" title="Scylla - a sea monster from Greek mythology">Scylla</a>, a symbol of the leader of the <i>Qhardi Separatist Army</i>. Meanwhile, <i>Togusa</i> investigates a murder of a man who was fitted with a prosthetic leg manufactured by the <i>Mermaid’s Legs</i> corporation <i>Akira Hose</i> works for, suspecting that <i>Kusanagi’s</i> lover is also somehow involved in the case, and trying to convince the Major to see the apparent connection. <i>Kusanagi</i> at first refuses to see the truth, but eventually, under the weight of irrefutable evidence, accepts that her lover is in fact <i>Scylla</i> – the leader of the separatists, and faces a difficult choice between her feelings for <i>Akira</i> and her duty as a member of the <i>Section 9</i>.</p>

            <p><b>Border 4: Ghost Stands Alone</b>, begins with the celebratory banquet at the headquarters of Japanese mega-corporation <i>Harimadara Heavy Industries</i>. Despite fierce protests and a massive demonstration outside, Harimadara just took over the Kuzan water company. The <i>Section 9</i> receives an anonymous tip-off that <i>Qhardi</i> terrorist group plans to conduct an unspecified attack to disrupt the event. The members of the <i>Section 9</i> are frantically trying to find out more to try and prevent the attack, but it is too late as the strike comes from the least expected direction. The riot police, who have their <i>‘ghosts’</i> hijacked by a cyber-virus known as <i>‘Fire-Starter’</i>, opens fire at the unarmed protesters outside the HQ, slaughtering dozens, before turning guns on each other, thus destroying the evidence. While <i>Qhardi</i> citizen <i>Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied</i> declares on live television that this is a revenge for the suffering of the people of <i>Qhardistan</i>, all the evidence points to <i>Emma Tsuda</i>, 17-year-old war orphan who makes cyberbrain games under the name <i>‘Tin Man’</i>, being the real perpetrator of the cyber attack. But when the Major analyses the girl’s cyberbrain, it becomes apparent that it is occupied by not one, but two ghosts: <i>‘Tin Girl’ Emma</i> and <i>‘Scarecrow’ Brinda Jr.</i> (both pseudonyms being characters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz" title="The Wonderful Wizard of Oz - American children's novel adapted to the iconic 1939 musical film">The Wizard of Oz</a>) and slowly uncovers a wide conspiracy involving powerful cartels, <i>Colonel Hozumi</i> from Army Intelligence and dirty cyberbrain business.</p>

                Logicomas (Logistics Conveyer Machines) are multi-purpose AI-equipped robotic weapons platforms with a quadrupedal exoskeleton. Spider-like in appearance, having four legs and a pair of front-mounted manipulators, Logicomas are often used by the Public Security Section 9 as bodyguards during the investigations.

            <p><b>Border 5: Pyrophoric Cult</b>, starts with a mid-air explosion of an airliner, claiming many innocent lives. The members of the <i>Section 9</i> determine, that similarly to the story arc of <i>Ghost Tears</i> where the limb-shaped <i>Ariel</i> bombs were used for terrorist attacks, the bomber blew himself, and the plane, up with an <i>Ariel</i> bomb. Clearly, the target was a group of foreign cyberbrain engineers who were on board of the <i>Flight 381</i>. Assigned on the case, <i>Borma</i> and <i>Ishikawa</i> manage to extract from the wreckage a damaged cyberbrain casing containing vital clues from which they are able to deduce first the name of the bomber – <i>Tei Murasaka</i>, a stockbroker with a dual Japanese/USA citizenship – and then his address. When <i>Batou</i> and <i>Togusa</i> raid the man’s apartment, they are caught out in a shootout with unknown men of American origin. It turns out that <i>Murasaka</i> was in fact undercover American Intelligence agent, and the men in the apartment were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency (NSA) - secretive intelligence organization of the United States government">NSA</a> agents, also assigned on the case. <i>Aramaki</i> informs <i>Kusanagi</i> about the connection between the attack on the <i>Flight 381</i> and the <i>Fire-Starter</i> cyber-virus. Later <i>Kusanagi</i> learns about the existence of the <i>Fire-Starter’s</i> broker, <i>Pyromania</i> (called thus because of the massive damage unleashed by his <i>Fire-Starter</i> cyber-virus wherever he appears). In the meantime, <i>Paz</i> learns that <i>Pyromania’s</i> true identity could be <i>Galvez Garcia</i>, an international cyber-drug dealer and that he is in Japan on a mission to eliminate <i>Colonel Hozumi</i>, who, though badly injured, survived the first assassination attempt in the previous story arc, <i>Ghost Stands Alone</i>. <i>Kusanagi</i> sets a trap, using <i>Hozumi</i>, or what is left of her, as a bait, to lure the <i>Fire-Starter’s</i> broker from his hiding, setting thus the stage for the final confrontation with <i>Pyromania</i>. Everything is not as it seems though and it slowly emerges that <i>Kurutsu</i>, the head of the Army’s <i>Organization 501</i>, might be the one who is quietly pulling the strings from the shadows…</p>

            <p>Although <i>Ghost in the Shell: Arise</i> marks a welcome return to the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> universe, and the individual films, or <i>‘borders’</i>, work quite well on their own right, collectively they fall short in replicating the unique atmosphere and peculiar, almost hypnotic, charm of the original 3 films of the franchise (<i>Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex – Solid State Society</i>).</p>
