            <p><i>Fashion Beast</i>, loosely based on the fairy tale <i>‘Beauty and the Beast’</i>, was originally conceived by <i>Alan Moore</i> in 1985 while he was working on the graphic novel <a href="comic-0009-watchmen.html" title="Watchmen, a seminal comic book written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons">Watchmen</a>, with the intention of it becoming a full length feature film.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_comics/comic0051-1.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: none;" />

            <p>The script was developed in co-operation with the late punk impresario <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McLaren" title="Malcolm Robert Andrew McLaren, former British musician, impresario, visual artist, performer and clothes designer">Malcolm McLaren</a>, who was pitching the [intended] film as <i>‘a mash-up of Beauty and the Beast and the life of Christian Dior’</i> and expected from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore" title="Alan Moore, influential English comic book writer">Alan Moore</a> to bring political depth and sexual politics to the mix, but <i>‘It was Malcolm who suggested that the main characters be a boy who looks like a girl … and vice versa.’</i> says <i>Alan Moore</i>.</p>
            <p>As a nod to McLaren’s contribution, the dedication reads: <i>“Dedicated to the memory of Malcolm McLaren. Too fast to live, too young to die.”</i></p>
            <p>The movie, as you would have already guessed, was never filmed and the screenplay lay in the drawer, collecting dust, for almost thirty years, until an independent American publisher of comic books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_Press" title="Avatar Press, American comic book publisher based in Rantoul, Illinois">Avatar Press</a> approached <i>Moore</i> with an idea to collaborate on a graphic novel adaptation of the script with an established British writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Johnston" title="Antony Johnston, British writer">Antony Johnston</a> (<i>Wasteland, Dead Space</i>). <i>Alan Moore</i> liked the idea. Illustrated by a relatively unknown artist <i>Facundo Percio</i>, <i>Fashion Beast</i> had a ten issue run, with the first issue released in September 2012.</p>

            <p>In a dystopian future, where jobs are scarce and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter" title="Nuclear winter, (a.k.a. Atomic winter), a hypothetical climatic effect following a global nuclear war">nuclear winter</a> is looming, style is everything and fashion is a lone lighthouse which shines through the gloomy clouds of desperation.</p>
            <p>The story of <i>Fashion Beast</i> focuses on <i>Doll</i>, a plain looking young girl, who works as a cloakroom lady in a trendy uptown nightclub. <i>Doll</i> is by no means ugly, but she is unattractive to a degree that she is often mistaken for a transvestite. During the daytime, <i>Doll</i> is an ordinary girl, but at night she dreams of stardom. After a young man, whom <i>Doll</i> refused entry to the club, mixes up all the numbers on the coats in her cloakroom, <i>Doll</i> finds herself fired and unemployed.</p>
            <p>Desperate to find a new job, she attends an audition to be a model for <i>Jean-Claude Celestine</i>, a much sought after fashion designer. Against all the odds, <i>Doll</i> wins the audition and is chosen to be <i>Celestine’s</i> new model. To her astonishment, <i>Doll</i> recognises in an effeminate apprentice designer <i>Jonni Tare</i>, who also works at <i>Celestine’s</i> fashion factory, the lad who vandalised her cloakroom and because of whom she lost her job. There is an an instant rivalry between the two, but also a hidden, and at first unfulfilled, attraction which they feel towards each other.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>One day <i>Celestine</i> invites <i>Doll</i> to his office and confesses to her, that he hides in his room at the top of his enormous fashion factory, designing clothing and playing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinatory,_esoteric_and_occult_tarot" title="Tarot cards, a pack of playing cards (most commonly numbering 78) used by occultists for Tarot reading to look into the past, present, and future events">tarot cards</a>, in order to conceal his disfigurement. <i>Celestine</i> also talks about his late mother, saying that she was very beautiful and that she often commented on his ugliness. <i>Doll</i> demands to see <i>Celestine’s</i> face and is astonished to see that far from being a monstrous freak, <i>Celestine</i> is in fact an incredibly attractive young man, and that his conviction of ugliness originates only from his mother’s words and a peculiar mirror that severely distorts his real appearance. When <i>Doll</i> confronts her managers, Madame D. and Madame S., they tell her that they know about this, and deliberately keep <i>Celestine</i> in the dark, because he is only capable of designing outstanding clothing designs while seeing himself as a hideous, tortured genius. One day, disillusioned <i>Celestine</i> slits his wrists in an attempt to break free from his plight and his fashion factory he sees as a prison.</p>
            <p>At <i>Celestine’s</i> last request, <i>Jonni</i> takes over as the head of the fashion house and the story comes full circle as <i>Jonni</i> discovers <i>Celestine’s</i> mirror and sees that it distorts his appearance in the same way as it did before <i>Celestine’s</i>…</p>

            <p>In his later years, unpredictable <i>Alan Moore</i>, to the great dismay of his fans, distanced himself from some of his former works. Themes of his stories and his writing style also changed considerably. It comes as a relief then, that the <i>Fashion Beast</i>, written more than a quarter of the century earlier, is something like a time capsule, preserving a pure and unblemished <i>Moore’s</i> essence from the times when he wrote such classic works like his seminal comic <a href="comic-0009-watchmen.html" title="Watchmen, a seminal comic book written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons">Watchmen</a>. <i>Fashion Beast</i> has its weak points, two of them being a slightly convoluted storyline (owing to its beginning as a screenplay) and the finale’s anti-climax, but it is nonetheless a required reading for all <i>Alan Moore’s</i> fans.</p>
