Her first collection, Hark! A Vagrant, spent five months on the New York Times bestseller list and topped best-of-the-year lists from Time, E!, Amazon, and Publishers Weekly. Beaton's cartoons often display a wonderfully light touch on historical and literary topics.

A Vagrant! collection Step Aside, Pops, published by Drawn & Quarterly.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b>Berkeley Breathed</b></p>

            <p>In the early 1980s, Breathed began drawing Bloom County, a political satire, for college newspapers. Nationwide recognition came with his creation of Opus, an insecure penguin who reflected the political conscience of America. He furthered his fame with his creation of Bill the Cat, who was the exact opposite of Opus in that he represented the scum of America. The combination of Opus and Bill was a huge success and saved Breathed from the near demise of his comic strip. When Bloom County ended, Breathed created Outland, a strip in which Opus, Bill, and several other characters resurfaced in a utopia-like world. After Outland, came Opus, a new comic strip featuring Opus, Bill and other characters. In 2015, Breathed brought back Bloom County in paperless form on Facebook, with a new collection due to be published in 2016.</p>

McElderry in 2014). In 2015 Carroll won the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist, two Eisner awards (including Best Short Story for her online comic When the Darkness Presses), and the British Fantasy Award for Best Comic/Graphic Novel.

            <p>A longtime veteran of the comic book business, serving as an artist and writer for nearly every publisher of comics in the past four decades, Chaykin took the 1990s off from comics to work on television, so he missed the money and dreck that was comics in that execrable decade. He is responsible for introducing a number of previously unexplored themes to comic books. Chaykin is generally better regarded by his colleagues than by the enthusiasts, a reality that serves more his ego than his wallet. These days, he's on a tear about the inexplicable Alpha position maintained by comic book writers at the expense of comic book artists, working on educating those aforementioned enthusiasts as to just what writing really means in the context of this visual medium.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b>Daniel Clowes</b></p>
