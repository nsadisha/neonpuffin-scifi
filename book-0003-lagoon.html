            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnedi_Okorafor" title="Nnedimma Nkemdili Okorafor, Nigerian-American writer of speculative fiction">Nnedi Okorafor</a> is a Nigerian-American writer of fantasy, science fiction and speculative fiction. A novelist whose stories reflect equally her West African heritage and her American existence, <i>Okorafor</i> is known for her complex, larger-than-life characters as well as for using exotic Nigerian settings and colourful cultures of her ancestral country as a basis for her fictional narratives.</p>

            <p><i>Lagoon</i> is not an exception. Three complete strangers (marine biologist <i>Adaora</i>, famous rapper <i>Anthony</i> and troubled soldier <i>Agu</i>), each living in his small inner world, thoroughly isolated from the outside world by their own problems, surrounded by crowds of people, yet feeling more alone than they have ever been before, are wandering along the famous <i>Bar Beach</i> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos" title="Lagos, the most populous city in Nigeria">Lagos</a>, Nigeria’s most populous city. In the normal circumstances, they would hardly ever meet, or, if they would chance upon each other, they would likely just walk past without even noticing each other.</p>

            <p>But these circumstances are anything but normal. A strange, massive, meteorite-like object crashes into the ocean just off the coast of <i>Lagos</i> and as a tidal wave overcomes them, these three disparate people will find themselves bound together in ways they could never imagine. Together with <i>Ayodele</i>, a visitor from beyond the stars, they must race through <i>Lagos</i> and against time in order to save the city, the country they love, the world... and themselves.</p>

            <p>Combining everything from ancient Nigerian mythology to modern superhero comics, but with a story about humanity at the crossroads at its heart, <i>Lagoon</i> touches on pressing political and philosophical issues and ultimately asks us to consider the things that bind us together and the things that make us human.</p>
