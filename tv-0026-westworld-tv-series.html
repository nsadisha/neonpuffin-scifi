            <p>Some of the more seasoned fans of science fiction may remember the cult 1973 sci-fi western-thriller film <i>Westworld</i>, written and directed by novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton" title="John Michael Crichton, American best-selling writer, best known for his work in the science fiction and thriller genres">Michael Crichton</a>, in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yul_Brynner" title="Yuly Borisovich 'Yul' Briner, Russian-born, American actor, best known for portraying gunman Chris Adams in 'The Magnificent Seven' western">Yul Brynner</a> stars as a sinister android gunslinger who malfunctions and goes on a shooting spree in a futuristic Wild West-themed amusement park.</p>

            <p>A remake of <i>Westworld</i> has been under consideration since the early 1990s, but a feature film re-imagining of this coveted sci-fi classic did not materialise. The hopes of the fans were invigorated when in August 2013 it was announced that the TV cable channel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO" title="HBO (Home Box Office) - an American cable and satellite television network">HBO</a> had commissioned a pilot for a potential television series based on the story, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Nolan" title="Jonathan 'Jonah' Nolan, British-born, American-based author, screenwriter, director and producer">Jonathan Nolan</a> directing and co-writing the script in collaboration with his wife <i>Lisa Joy</i>. The powers that be liked the pilot and in November 2014 ordered a full series of the show, that was set to premiere in 2015.</p>

            <p>In August 2015, <i>HBO</i> released the first <a href="http://www.hbo.com/westworld/about/video/westworld-tease" title="Watch teaser of Westworld TV series">teaser</a> of the upcoming one-hour, ten-episode drama series, with an announcement that the show will premiere sometime in 2016. Since then, the series experienced some hiatus, but according to <i>HBO</i> it is still slated for 2016 debut, and if all goes well, we should see the first episode of the new show sometime during the autumn 2016.</p>
