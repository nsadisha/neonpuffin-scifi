            <p class="shift_paragraph_up">Based on a <i>real-life</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Mountain_Lights" title="'Brown Mountain Lights' phenomenon">Brown Mountain Lights</a> phenomenon reported near <i>Brown Mountain in North Carolina</i>, this is a <i>‘found footage’</i> film depicting an ordeal of <i>Morris family</i> while on a camping trip in a remote, sparsely populated woodland area near the aforementioned <i>Brown Mountain, North Carolina</i>.</p>

            <p>On the last night of their trip, the family, consisting of <i>Riley</i> - an eleven year old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism" title="Autism - disorder characterised by impaired social interaction">autistic</a> boy, his older brother <i>Corey</i>, sister <i>Jillian</i> and their parents <i>Peter</i> and <i>Katie</i>, observe three inexplicable star-like objects moving in the sky.</p>

            <p>The following morning they leave the camping site and things start to go pear-shaped from that point on. <i>Peter</i>, who is driving, loses his bearing after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" title="GPS - acronym for Global Positioning System">GPS</a> fails, then cell phone signal disappears, and when <i>Peter</i> announces that he can't find the way out of the woods and the car is running low on fuel, a real sense of panic sets in. Unfortunately, the family don't know that the worst is yet to come...</p>

            <p>The film is centred upon <i>Riley's</i> continuous use of his camcorder throughout his family’s ordeal (thus creating a video journal that will be later found, forming the narrative of this <i>‘found footage’</i> movie) and gives a good rationale for <i>Riley</i> to continue filming even in the situations when any other sane person would drop the camera and start running, hinting that <i>Riley</i> is using the camcorder as a coping mechanism for his autistic condition. Apparently, a psychologist told the film director that he had treated an autistic child who videotaped everything that he did.</p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_cinema/cinema0026-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>The plot unravels along the familiar lines: bird flocks hitting the windows of the car, far-too-bright-to-bear sterile white lights flooding the rooms through the closed window shutters, eerie inhumanly-looking silhouettes lurking in the dark - <i>Alien Abduction</i> has it all. Despite – or perhaps because of – all this fairly generic ingredients, seen in one form or another many times before, the film fails to capitalise</p>

            <p class="shift_paragraph_up">on the interesting premise and it's ultimately rather unsatisfying as both <i>'found footage'</i> science fiction film and as a horror movie.</p>
