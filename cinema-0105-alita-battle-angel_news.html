            <p><i>Battle Angel Alita</i> tells the story of <i>Alita</i> (called <i>‘Gally’</i> in the original Japanese version), an amnesiac female cyborg, whose intact torso, in suspended animation, is found by cybernetic expert <i>Daisuke Ido</i> on the local dump in the futuristic dystopian city of <i>Scrapyard</i>, which sprawls around a massive scrap heap that rains down from the floating city of <i>Tiphares</i>, that is based in a post-apocalyptic United States in 26th century. Ground dwellers, many extensively enhanced by cybernetics to better cope with their testing life, have no access to <i>Tiphares</i> and are forced to make despondent living in the gruelling conditions of the slum below. <i>Tiphares</i> exploits the <i>Scrapyard</i> and surrounding areas, paying mercenaries (called <i>Hunter-Warriors</i>) to hunt down criminals and organising violent sports, such as <i>Motorball</i>, to keep the masses entertained. <i>Ido</i> manages to revive the cyborg, and, finding she has lost all her memories, names her <i>Alita</i> after his late pet cat. The rebuilt <i>Alita</i> soon recalls that she is an expert in the legendary martial art <i>‘Panzer Kunst’</i>, although she does not remember anything beyond this. <i>Alita</i> uses her <i>Panzer Kunst</i> skills to first become a mercenary <i>Hunter-Warrior</i>, killing cyborg criminals in the <i>Scrapyard</i>, and then a player in the brutal sport of <i>Motorball</i>. While in combat, she experiences flashbacks from her earlier life on Mars. Later, <i>Alita</i> starts working for the floating city of <i>Tiphares</i> as one of its agents, and is sent to hunt down various criminals, amongst them the mad genius <i>Desty Nova</i>, who first clashes with <i>Alita</i>, but eventually becomes her trusted ally.</p>

                    Production of the big screen version of Battle Angel Alita experienced multiple hiatuses due to James Cameron’s engagement with upcoming Avatar sequels
                </span>

            <p><i>Yukito Kishiro’s</i> cult manga series was originally brought to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Francis Cameron, Canadian filmmaker and deep-sea explorer">James Cameron’s</a> attention by filmmaker <i>Guillermo del Toro</i>. <i>Cameron</i> immediately became enamored with the story of enigmatic cyborg heroine and made clear his intention to try and bring <i>Battle Angel Alita</i> to the big screen. He has stated that he wants to adapt <i>“the spine story”</i> of the manga to a feature film, with the same mix of live-action and computer-generated imagery that he recently used to a great effect in his blockbuster <a href="cinema-0082-avatar-2.html" title="Avatar - preview of the film's four sequels">Avatar</a>. Because of the considerable extent of the source material, <i>Cameron</i> resolved to limit the film adaptation to the first four books of the original manga series, with a particular focus on the brutal futuristic sport <i>Motorball</i> as depicted in the third and fourth volume of the manga series.</p>

            <p>The feature film, from a screenplay by <i>James Cameron</i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laeta_Kalogridis" title="Laeta Elizabeth Kalogridis, American screenwriter as well as television and film producer">Laeta Kalogridis</a>, will be directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rodriguez" title="Robert Anthony Rodriguez, American screenwriter and filmmaker">Robert Rodriguez</a> (<i>From Dusk till Dawn, The Faculty, Sin City, Predators</i>), while <i>Cameron</i> will co-produce the movie with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Landau_(film_producer)" title="Jon Landau, American film producer">Jon Landau</a>, a veteran co-operator with whom he produced in the past such blockbusters as <i>Titanic</i> and <i>Avatar</i>, as well as a critically well received, though commercially unsuccessful, science fiction drama <i>Solaris</i>. Film producers cast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Salazar" title="Rosa Bianca Salazar, American actress">Rosa Salazar</a> as <i>Alita</i>, the titular character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Waltz" title="Christoph Waltz, Austrian-German actor">Christoph Waltz</a> as <i>Dr. Dyson Ido, Alita’s</i> mentor and a scientist, <i>Keean Johnson</i> as <i>Hugo, Alita’s</i> love interest and teacher of <i>Motorball</i> game and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Skrein" title="Edward George 'Ed' Skrein, English rapper and actor">Ed Skrein</a> as antagonist <i>Zapan</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Condor" title="Lana Therese Condor, Vietnamese-American actress">Lana Condor</a> will also appear, starring as <i>Koyomi</i>, an orphaned teenage freelance photographer, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahershala_Ali" title="Mahershalalhashbaz 'Mahershala' Ali Gilmore, American rapper and actor">Mahershala Ali</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Rodriguez" title="Mayte Michelle Rodriguez, American actress">Michelle Rodriguez</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Zaror" title="Marko Zaror Aguad, Chilean martial artist, stuntman and actor">Marko Zaror</a> will feature respectively as <i>Vector, Gelda</i> and <i>Ajakutty</i> – all characters involved in the <i>Motorball</i> sport.</p>
