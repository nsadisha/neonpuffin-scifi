            <p>3 July 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the 80s cult sci-fi comedy film <i>Back to the Future</i>. In the movie, <i>Marty McFly</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox" title="Michael J. Fox, Canadian-American actor best known for his role as Marty McFly in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy">Michael J. Fox</a>) and his loyal friend <i>Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lloyd" title="Christopher Allen Lloyd, American actor best known for his role as Emmett 'Doc' Brown in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy">Christopher Lloyd</a>) embark on various time-travel adventures.</p>
            <p>In the 1989 sequel, <i>Back to the Future Part II</i>, <i>Marty</i> & <i>Doc</i> travel <i>‘back to the future’</i>, i.e. to the year 2015, on a mission to try and prevent <i>McFly’s</i> future son from getting into trouble with the law and ending up in jail.</p>
            <p>While in the year 2015, <i>Marty</i> & <i>Doc</i> encounter a plethora of gizmos and gadgets strange to them, but common to the future folks who use them in their everyday lives. Now, when we have finally made it to 2015 without a time machine, let see if any of the movie’s predictions have actually come true…</p>

            <br/><h2>Flying car</h2><h4>A car that lifts-off from the road and takes to the skies</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">Flying car was without a doubt the best invention featured in <i>‘Back to the Future’</i>, but more than 30 years later, we are nowhere closer to making this dream a reality. While there were some concept <i>‘flying cars’</i> before, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moller_M400_Skycar" title="Moller Skycar - a prototype personal VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft a.k.a. 'flying car' invented by Paul Moller">Moller Skycar</a>, so far all these were essentially small aircraft and none of them achieved free flight out of ground. The first fully functioning <i>‘flying car’</i> making use of existing infrastructure created for both cars and planes is probably <a href="http://www.gcgmag.com/gadget0008-aeromobil-2-5.html" title="Aeromobil - a first fully functioning 'flying car' that makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes">Aeromobil</a>, built by a team of enthusiasts from <i>Bratislava, Slovakia</i>, but even this is little more than a foldable, although roadworthy, aeroplane that still needs a runway for takeoff.</p>

            <br/><h2>Hoverboard</h2><h4>A skateboard without wheels, hovering above the ground as by magic</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">Although a fully-fledged hoverboard, as seen in <i>Back to the Future Part II</i>, has yet to materialise, a couple of recent inventions came pretty close. The first of these, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSheVhmcYLA" title="Hendo Hover - world's first functional hoverboard tested by legendary professional skateboarder Tony Hawk">Hendo</a>, invented by <i>Greg Henderson</i>, uses four engines to carry up to 135 kilograms while hovering one inch above the ground, but requires a <i>non-ferromagnetic</i> metal surface to function, as it works on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_levitation" title="Magnetic levitation a.k.a. MAGLEV - a method by which an object is suspended in the air with no support other than magnetic field (requires non-ferromagnetic but highly conductive materials like aluminium or copper)">magnetic levitation</a> principle. The second, <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/5/video-watch-incredible-footage-of-farthest-flight-by-a-hoverboard-record-set-by-379420" title="Propeller-driven hoverboard created by Canadian inventor of Romanian descent Catalin Alexandru Duru, creates a world record as it flies a total distance of 275.9 metres over waters of Lake Ouareau in Quebec, Canada">propeller-driven hoverboard</a> created by Canadian inventor <i>Catalin Alexandru Duru</i>, can hover over any surface (even over water – eat your heart out <i>Marty McFly</i>) but has a limited range of about 300 metres.</p>

            <br/><h2>Smart Clothing</h2><h4>Self-drying jackets and self-lacing shoes</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">While you won’t be able to buy a self-drying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperGroup" title="Superdry - the label of SuperGroup plc - a British branded clothing company">Superdry</a> jacket in your local clothing store any time soon (if ever), 2015 could be the year when we finally see the self-lacing trainers. <i>“Are we going to see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes.”</i> announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Hatfield" title="Tinker Haven Hatfield, Jr., designer and vice president for design and special projects at Nike">Tinker Hatfield</a>, shoe designer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc." title="Nike, Inc. - an American corporation engaged in design, development, manufacturing and worldwide sales of footwear and related accessories">Nike</a>, at a press conference last year. Meanwhile smart clothing slowly takes shape in the form of perhaps slightly less dramatic, but probably much more practical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-textiles" title="E-textiles a.k.a. smart garments or smart clothing - fabrics that enable digital components to be embedded in them">electronic textiles</a> that monitor vital signs of the wearer, such as heart rate and body temperature, as well as smart clothes designed for training data acquisition in sport.</p>

            <br/><h2>Smart Glasses</h2><h4>A wearable computer that projects images into the wearer's field of vision</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">OK, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass" title="Google Glass - wearable technology with an optical head-mounted display developed by Google">Google Glass</a>, smart glasses developed by <a href="https://www.google.com" title="Google Inc. - an American multinational technology company specialising in Internet-related services and products, best known for their Google web search engine">Google</a>, may have flopped amidst concerns regarding the intrusion of privacy, but optical head-mounted displays are here to stay, in one form or another. While <i>Google Glass</i> undergoes a radical redesign overseen by former <i>Apple</i> designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Fadell" title="Anthony Michael 'Tony' Fadell, a Lebanese American inventor, designer, entrepreneur and angel investor, formerly the Vice President of the iPod division at Apple Inc.">Tony Fadell</a>, who was instrumental in bringing <i>Apple’s iPod</i> to market, other companies are coming with their own versions of smart glasses, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft Corporation - an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures and sells computer software (mainly operating systems) and consumer electronics">Microsoft</a> with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Holographic#Microsoft_HoloLens" title="Microsoft HoloLens - a smart glasses unit that is effectively a cordless, self-contained Windows 10 computer">HoloLens</a> augmented reality unit. Meantime, <a href="http://www.gcgmag.com/gadget0001-oculus-rift.html" title="Oculus Rift - a virtual reality head-mounted display developed by Oculus VR">Oculus Rift</a>, a virtual reality head-mounted display, is set to bring about a complete revolution in video gaming.</p>

            <br/><h2>Weather Control</h2><h4>Sunny through the day and rain when we actually need it</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;"><i>“First, you’ve gotta get out and change clothes.”</i> says Doc Brown to Marty McFly just as their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine" title="DeLorean time machine - a fictional automobile-based time travel device featured in the 'Back to the Future' franchise">DeLorean</a> touches down in the future. <i>“Right now? It’s pouring rain.”</i> objects <i>Marty</i>. <i>“Wait five more seconds. Right on the tick. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Too bad the post office isn’t as efficient as the weather service.”</i> While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_modification" title="Weather modification - the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather, such as cloud seeding to encourage rainfall">weather modification</a> will likely stay in the realm of science fiction, a short-range weather forecasts have become more accurate, thanks to supercomputers acquired by meteorological agencies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office" title="Met Office - the United Kingdom's national weather service headquartered in Exeter, Devon">Met Office’s</a> new £97 million computer, that, <i>Met Office</i> says, will deliver a <i>“step change”</i> in forecast accuracy.</p>

            <img class="image_book_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0085-07.png" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <br/><h2>Hands-Free Gaming</h2><h4>Look, no hands! Or, who needs a game controller?</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;"><i>“You mean you have to use your hands?”</i> sneers a little boy after <i>Marty</i> shoots a perfect score with the electronic gun at the video game arcade in the future version of his home town in 2015. <i>“That’s like a baby’s toy!”</i> adds the second boy. The film correctly predicted a future where playing video games doesn’t require hands, as proven by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect" title="Kinect - motion sensing input device by Microsoft for Xbox 360 and Xbox One video game consoles and Windows-based PCs">Microsoft Kinect</a> motion sensing game controller for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One" title="Xbox One - home video game console developed by Microsoft (the third console in the Xbox family)">Xbox One</a> game console. Some companies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotiv_Systems" title="Emotiv Systems - an Australian electronics company developing electroencephalography-based brain–computer interfaces">Emotiv Systems</a> with their <i>Emotiv EPOC</i> neuroheadset, are even researching ways of utilising brain-computer interfaces to control video games by the power of thought alone.</p>

            <br/><h2>Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor</h2><h4>A Home Energy Reactor that creates energy from household waste</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">The <i>DeLorean</i> time machine that featured in the <i>Back to the Future</i> trilogy is powered by a nuclear reactor using plutonium fuel to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity required to activate the <i>flux capacitor</i> which is the core component of the time machine. <i>Doc Brown</i> later outfits his <i>DeLorean</i> sports car with <i>Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor</i> that turns assorted household waste to clean energy. Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion" title="Cold fusion - a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature">cold fusion</a> nuclear reactor will most likely remain a dream, the UK’s first 40-seat <i>‘Bio-Bus’</i>, that runs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas" title="Bio-methane a.k.a. Biogas - a mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen">bio-methane</a> gas generated from human faeces and food waste, has gone into service between <i>Bristol</i> and <i>Bath</i>.</p>

            <br/><h2>Large Flat-Panel TV Sets, Video Chat and Social Media</h2><h4>A large-screen private cinema in every home</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">One scene in the film depicts <i>Marty</i> having a video chat with his colleague <i>D. J. Needles</i>. While the two discuss a dodgy business deal, the large wall-mounted TV displays <i>Needles’s</i> basic personal information, including name, dietary habits, sport preferences and political affiliation. This is one prediction that came completely true. Nowadays, large-size flat-screen television sets have become all but the norm, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing" title="Videoconferencing - the conduct of a videoconference using telecommunication technologies which allow two or more locations to communicate by simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions">video conferencing</a> platforms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" title="Skype - a software product that specialises in providing voice calls and video chat from computers and mobile devices via the Internet">Skype</a> help us to connect with our family, friends and colleagues worldwide, while social media networks such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook - an online social networking service that enables users to create a circle of 'friends' who can then share posts and exchange messages">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com" title="Twitter - an online social networking service that enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called 'tweets'">Twitter</a> are all-pervasive in all walks of life.</p>

            <br/><h2>Dehydrated Pizza</h2><h4>A cookie-sized dry pizza that, once hydrated, turns into a full-sized pizza</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:6px;">As the <i>McFly</i> family gathers around the dinner table, grandma <i>Lorraine</i> places a small, dehydrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut" title="Pizza Hut - an American restaurant chain and international franchise, known mainly for their pizza and side dishes">Pizza Hut</a> pizza at a metal plate, puts it into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_Decker" title="Black & Decker Corporation - an American manufacturer of power tools, hardware and accessories">Black & Decker</a> hydrator and utters <i>“Hydrate level 4, please!”</i> into a small grille on the device. She waits a few seconds, opens the hydrator and voila – the pizza comes out normal size, piping hot and ready to eat. Unfortunately, at the moment, the only known way to rehydrate anything is to submerge it in boiling water. However, we can produce a variety of customised foodstuffs via the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing" title="Three-dimensional printing a.k.a. 3D printing - procedure used to make a three-dimensional objects by means of an additive process in which successive layers of material are laid down under computer control">3D Printing</a>, including candy, chocolate, crackers, pasta, and – wait for it – pizza!</p>
