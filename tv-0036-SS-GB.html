            <p>Imagine the scenario: In 1940, the Germans landed near Ashford, Kent, overwhelmed the surprised and ill-prepared coastal defence forces and quickly advanced on London, which fell shortly after, following a short but fierce battle. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion" title="Operation Sea Lion - code name for a proposed invasion of the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany during the Second World War">Operation Sea Lion</a> was a success, though a British rear guard around Colchester slowed the German advance for long enough to enable Royal Navy ships to escape from Harwich harbour. Although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain" title="Battle of Britain - the defence of the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force against an onslaught of the Luftwaffe during the Second World War which began at the end of June 1940">Battle of Britain</a> continued for several few months, in 1941 the British Armed Forces surrendered, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill" title="Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War from 1940 to 1945 and then again from 1951 to 1955">Winston Churchill</a> was arrested, tried by a court-martial in Berlin and summarily executed, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI" title="George VI, King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth from 11 December 1936 until his death on 6 February 1952">King George VI</a> was incarcerated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London#Foundation_and_early_history" title="Tower of London - a historic castle located in central London on the north bank of the river Thames, founded by William the Conqueror in 1078">Tower of London</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler, German politician, leader of the NSDAP (Nazi Party), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Führer (leader) of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945">Hitler</a> held a victory parade in London.</p>
            <p>That is the premise of <i>SS-GB</i>, a hotly anticipated BBC television drama adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Deighton" title="Leonard Cyril Deighton (writing as Len Deighton), British author known mainly for his military history novels">Len Deighton’s</a> dystopian, alternative history novel of the same name. The script for the 5-episode series has been penned by one of the UK’s most successful writing teams – Bafta award-winning tandem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Purvis_and_Robert_Wade" title="Neal Purvis, British screenwriter best known for co-writing (with Robert Wade) five James Bond films from 'The World is not Enough' to 'Skyfall'">Neal Purvis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Purvis_and_Robert_Wade" title="Robert Wade, British screenwriter best known for co-writing (with Neal Purvis) five James Bond films from 'The World is not Enough' to 'Skyfall'">Robert Wade</a> who have previously cooperated on five <i>James Bond</i> films from <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> to <i>Skyfall</i>.</p>

                Following the successful invasion of the British Isles, Hitler likely wouldn't be able to resist the temptation of staging a victory parade in front of Buckingham Palace.

            <p>Set in Nazi-occupied London less than a year after Britain’s surrender after the Germans won the <i>Battle of Britain, SS-GB</i> tells the story of British detective <i>Douglas Archer</i>, who finds himself working under the brutal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel" title="SS (German acronym for Schutzstaffel [Protection Squadron]) - a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany">SS</a> in enemy-controlled London. When investigating what appears to be a simple black market murder, Archer is dragged into a much more dangerous game where the stakes are as high as the ultimate outcome of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="Second World War a.k.a. World War II - a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved all of the great powers and vast majority of other world's nations">Second World War</a>.</p>
            <p>The lead role in the upcoming television series has been given to British actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Riley" title="Sam Riley, English actor">Sam Riley</a>, who will be portraying <i>Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer</i> of Scotland Yard who in following up a routine murder case uncovers a web of intrigue involving British atomic weapons research secrets, which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abwehr" title="Abwehr (German for 'Defence') - a German military intelligence organization which existed from 1920 to 1945">Abwehr</a> would be very keen to get their hands on. American actress <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bosworth" title="Catherine Ann 'Kate' Bosworth, American actress and model">Kate Bosworth</a> will be starring alongside <i>Riley</i> as <i>Barbara Barga</i>, a shrewd American journalist who becomes inextricably linked with the murder case that <i>Archer</i> is investigating.</p>
            <p>Far from being a formulaic dystopian affair, the series sets out to explore the dark recesses of human psyche and ambiguity of moral choices when it poses the question of how one would act if presented with the choice: conform to the new rules and collaborate with the enemy for sake of self-preservation, or refuse collaboration with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism - National Socialism (a.k.a. Nazism) - the ideology associated with the German Nazi state, Nazi Party as well as other far-right groups in Nazi Germany, characterised as a form of fascism that incorporated selective racism and anti-Semitism">Nazis</a> on principle, join the resistance, but in the process risk arrest, imprisonment, torture and death not only for oneself but also for one’s family.</p>

            <p>The show is directed by highly-acclaimed German director <i>Philipp Kadelbach</i>, marking his first move into English-language filmmaking. The production began in October 2015 with filming taking place in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highgate_Cemetery" title="Highgate Cemetery - a place of burial in north London, England, designated Grade I on the Historic Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England">Highgate Cemetery</a> among other locations.</p>
            <p>The <i>SS-GB</i> television mini-series is produced by <i>Patrick Schweitzer</i> and will air on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One" title="BBC One - the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the United Kingdom">BBC One</a> later in 2016.</p>
