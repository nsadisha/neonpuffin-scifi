            <p><i>Space Station 76</i> is a directorial debut of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Plotnick" title="Jack Stuart Plotnick, American film and television actor, scriptwriter and producer">Jack Plotnick</a>, American film and television actor best known for his reoccurring role as <i>Deputy Mayor Allan Finch</i> in <i>‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’</i>. <i>Plotnick</i> says that the film’s idea came to him almost 10 years ago and he later developed the film’s script during a series of improvised sessions with some of his favourite actors at his home. The film saw some limited theatrical release in the United States before being offered via video-on-demand services.</p>

            <p>The whole storyline of <i>Space Station 76</i>, a science fiction dark comedy, takes place aboard the <i>Omega 76 Refuelling Station</i> within an alternative timeline where the swinging 70s never ended.</p>

            <p>The plot revolves primarily around four main characters: <i>Captain Glenn Terry</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Wilson_%28American_actor%29" title="Patrick Joseph Wilson, American actor and singer">Patrick Wilson</a>), closeted gay man, who turns to alcohol and has a string of aborted suicide attempts, after his internal struggle with his suppressed homosexuality caused his break up with <i>Daniel</i>, his former co-pilot and boyfriend; <i>Jessica Marlowe</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Tyler" title="Liv Rundgren Tyler, American actress">Liv Tyler</a>), who recently arrived at the station as the new co-pilot and replacement for <i>Daniel</i>, which puts her at odds with effeminate <i>Captain Glenn</i>; <i>Ted</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bomer" title="Matthew Staton Bomer, American actor">Matt Bomer</a>), the unhappily married station’s mechanic with a robotic right hand, who develops a friendship with <i>Jessica</i>; and <i>Misty</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Coughlan" title="Marisa Christine Coughlan, American actress">Marisa Coughlan</a>), <i>Ted’s</i> egocentric and shallow wife and station 's nutritionist, who cheats on her husband, feels threatened by <i>Jessica's</i> arrival at the station, and is constantly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam" title="Diazepam, originally marketed as 'Valium', a benzodiazepine drug">Valium</a> prescribed by <i>Dr. Bot</i>, the lethargic on-board robotic psychologist.</p>

            <p>Cuteness is supplied by <i>Sunshine</i>, <i>Ted's</i> and <i>Misty's</i> neglected, animal-loving daughter, and some titillation factor by <i>‘Space Angel’</i> (in the form of shapely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Sophia_Berglund" title="Anna Sophia Berglund, American Playboy magazine model, adult model and actress">Anna Sophia Berglund</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy, American men's lifestyle magazine featuring photographs of nude women">Playboy</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Playmate" title="Playmate, a female model featuring in the centrefold of Playboy magazine">Playmate</a>) regularly seen by <i>Ted</i> outside the station after smoking a joint of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_%28drug%29" title="Cannabis a.k.a. Marijuana, plant used as a psychoactive drug">marijuana</a>, but it is <i>Patrick Wilson</i> who excels in his role as turtleneck-sweater-wearing, dodgy-moustache-sporting, closet homosexual <i>Captain Glenn</i>.</p>
