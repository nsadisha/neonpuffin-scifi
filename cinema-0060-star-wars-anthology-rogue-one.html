            <p>As if the new <a href="cinema-0037-star-wars-episode-7-the-force-awakens-countdown.html#244days" title="Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens - screenshots and theatrical teaser trailer">teaser trailer</a> of the eagerly awaited <i>Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens</i> wasn’t enough, thousands of excited fans at the <i>Star Wars Celebration</i> convention in Anaheim, California learned also about the plot of <i>Star Wars: Rogue One</i>, the first of the, so far, two planned <i>Star Wars</i> spin-off films.</p>
            <p>The rough outline of the plot has been revealed to thousands of exhilarated fans by British director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Edwards_%28director%29" title="Gareth Edwards, English film director, screenwriter and visual effects artist">Gareth Edwards</a>, who is to helm the first of the big-screen stand-alone adventures exploring stories of the characters and events outside the core <i>Star Wars</i> saga.</p>
            <p>Film’s director <i>Gareth Edwards</i> was joined in a panel discussion by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_%28film_producer%29" title="Kathleen Kennedy, American film producer and president of Lucasfilm">Kathleen Kennedy</a>, the president of <i>Lucasfilm</i> and the brand manager of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, as well as <i>Lucasfilm’s</i> <i>Kiri Hart</i> and <i>Pablo Hidalgo</i>, and <i>Industrial Light and Magic’s</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knoll" title="John Knoll, visual effects supervisor and chief creative officer at Industrial Light & Magic">John Knoll</a> (who came with the original idea for the <i>Rogue One</i>).</p>

                The teaser shows a lone TIE-fighter flying over a ravine on a forested planet with the Death Star visible in orbit.
            </div>

            <p><i>Edwards</i> divulged to the assembled audience the rough outline of the film’s plot, that will revolve around a rogue group of resistance fighters who unite for a daring mission to steal the <i>Death Star</i> plans and bring a new hope to the Galaxy, before treating them to some concept art and even a short teaser video, featuring a <i>TIE-fighter</i> flying above a heavily-forested gorge with the <i>Death Star</i> orbiting the planet just visible in the background, that caused a packed room to erupt in cheers.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:0px;">The movie will be set before the first part of the original <i>Star Wars</i> series, later renamed <i>‘Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope’</i>. The first film of the <i>Star Wars</i> saga was released in 1977 and began with the <i>Empire’s</i> pursuit of <i>Tantive IV</i>, a spaceship carrying <i>Princess Leia</i> with the blueprints of the <i>Death Star</i> – the <i>Galactic Empire’s</i> most powerful weapon.</p>
            <p>It then logically follows that the rebels from the upcoming <i>‘Rogue One’</i> film will succeed in their effort to appropriate the <i>Death Star</i> drafts and hand them over to <i>Leia Organa, Princess of Alderaan</i> and a member of the <i>Imperial Senate</i>.</p>
            <p><i>Edwards</i> explained that because the <i>Jedi Knights</i> were all but wiped out in the preceding film <i>‘Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith’</i>, his story will be different from the other <i>Star Wars</i> movies.</p>
            <p>He said: [since <i>‘Rogue One’</i> takes place in the immediate aftermath of the destruction of the <i>Jedi</i> order] <i>“The absence of the Jedi is omnipresent.”</i> Instead of characters relying on the power of an unpredictable <i>Force</i> to save them, the film will centre around real, grounded human issues. <i>“It’s about the fact that God’s not coming to save us … we have to do this ourselves”</i>, said <i>Edwards</i>, before continuing: <i>“It comes down to a group of individuals that don’t have magic powers … that have to bring hope to the galaxy.”</i></p>
            <p><i>Edwards</i>, a lifelong <i>Star Wars</i> fan, also pointed out that in the previous instalments of the <i>Star Wars</i> saga characters were clearly defined as good or bad, that it was a very <i>“black and white”</i> universe. He stated that he wanted <i>‘Rogue One’</i> to be more complex than that, and that he will focus on the <i>“shades of grey”</i> in the galaxy far, far away – where the lines between good guys and bad guys aren’t so clearly defined – basically, sometimes the bad guys can be good and the good guys can be bad.</p>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicity_Jones" title="Felicity Rose Hadley Jones, English actress">Felicity Jones</a> is so far the only confirmed cast member of the forthcoming <i>Star Wars</i> spin-off film. According to <i>Kathleen Kennedy</i>, the choice of the British Oscar-nominee who will play a rebel soldier, is a deliberate attempt to have a mixture of realistic and powerful characters of both sexes in the movie.</p>
            <p>Additionally, <i>Kennedy</i> announced that all the future stand-alone <i>Star Wars</i> films will be referred to as the <i>‘Star Wars Anthology’</i> films, that will delve into previously untapped corners of the established <i>Star Wars</i> universe.</p>
            <p><i>Kennedy</i> credited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Walton Lucas, Jr., American film screenwriter, director, producer and entrepreneur">George Lucas</a> with encouraging the idea for the anthology films. <i>“It was really George’s idea, not only picking up the saga again – which he never envisioned he would do – he was really interested in exploring all the stories that might exist within the universe.”</i></p>
            <p>Earlier, director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Trank" title="Joshua Benjamin 'Josh' Trank, American film screenwriter and director">Josh Trank</a> (<i>Chronicle</i>) was announced as the director of the second, as yet untitled, <i>Star Wars Anthology</i> feature film.</p>

            <p><i>Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One</i> starts filming in the UK in summer 2015 and the movie will hit the cinemas on 16 December 2016.</p>
