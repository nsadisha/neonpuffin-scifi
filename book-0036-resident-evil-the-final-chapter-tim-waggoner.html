            <p>At the same time as <i>Resident Evil: The Final Chapter</i> – the latest instalment in the <i>Resident Evil</i> science fiction action-horror film series (based on the survival horror video game franchise of the same name) hits the cinemas, the British publishing house <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Books" title="Titan Publishing Group - an independently owned British company, publishing books, graphic novels and comics">Titan Books</a> comes with the official movie novelisation of the aforementioned blockbuster, coming from the pen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Waggoner" title="Tim Waggoner, a prolific American author writing in the science fiction, fantasy, horror, supernatural and thriller genres">Tim Waggoner</a>, a prolific American author writing in the sci-fi, fantasy, horror and thriller genres, who has in the past produced a number of other novelisations of well known fiction franchises, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_(TV_series)" title="Grimm - occult-detective drama television series">Grimm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1" title="Stargate SG-1 - military science fiction television series">Stargate SG-1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(U.S._TV_series)" title="Supernatural - fantasy-horror television series">Supernatural</a> TV series.</p>

                    Resident Evil: The Final Chapter isn’t one of the best science fiction novels around, owing to the mediocre film that served as the source material.

            <p>Deceived, all <i>Alice’s</i> friends die for this unworthy goal, but <i>Alice</i> miraculously survives and soon happens upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Resident_Evil_film_characters#Red_Queen" title="Red Queen - An Artificial Intelligence and one of the main antagonists throughout the 'Resident Evil' film series">Red Queen</a> who informs her that <i>Umbrella</i> developed an airborne antivirus that can not only stop the infection, but in the process destroy also all those infected by the <i>T-virus</i> that caused the pandemic. There is a catch though – the cure for the outbreak is stored at a safe location within the <i>Hive</i> - <i>Umbrella's</i> top-secret research facility located underneath <i>Raccoon City</i> – and <i>Alice</i> has only 48 hours to get there and release the antivirus.</p>
            <p><i>Alice</i> loses no time and immediately sets off for <i>Raccoon City</i>, but is soon captured by armed men and imprisoned inside a hold of <i>Umbrella's</i> armoured vehicle that is followed by an enormous army of undead and is heading for the same destination - <i>Raccoon City</i>, on a mission to wipe out one if the last remaining large groups of survivors that found a refuge there. To <i>Alice's</i> total shock, the vehicle is commanded by <i>Dr. Alexander Isaacs</i> – the very <i>Isaacs</i> whom she had personally killed (or at least she thought she had) a long time ago. It turns out that the version of <i>Dr. Isaacs</i> she dispatched was only a clone, leaving the original to personally oversee the final decisive onslaught of <i>Umbrella Corporation</i> against the last remnants of the human race.</p>

            <p>Incredibly, <i>Alice</i> manages to escape <i>Dr. Isaacs's</i> transport on a stolen motorbike and at last, with only some 8 hours to spare, she reaches <i>Raccoon City</i> where she discovers, and joins, a small band of survivors, including her old friend <i>Claire Redfield</i>. <i>Alice</i> wants to head immediately for the <i>Hive</i>, but the survivors persuade her to first make a stance against the incoming hordes of the undead and other assorted mutant monsters unleashed on them by <i>Dr. Isaacs</i>. Against the overwhelming odds, with <i>Alice's</i> help and cunningness, they defeat the undead and finally, now with only little over an hour to spare, <i>Alice</i>, accompanied by <i>Claire</i> and some of her friends: <i>Doc, Michael, Abigail</i> and <i>Christian</i>, set out for the <i>Hive</i>, located at the bottom of an immense crater gaping at the spot where once stood the centre of <i>Raccoon City</i>.</p>
            <p>In a nerve-racking race against time, <i>Alice</i> and her companions finally make it into the <i>Hive</i>, only for <i>Alice</i> to see her friends being taken out, one by one, by the security measures, sophisticated traps, and assorted monstrosities within, until only she and <i>Claire</i> remain alive to face <i>Isaacs</i> and <i>Wesker</i> and, with some little help from the <i>Red Queen</i>, try to wrestle from them the antivirus which is the humanity's only hope.</p>

            <p><i>Resident Evil: The Final Chapter</i> isn’t one of the best science fiction novels around, but so isn’t the film that served as the source material for this official movie novelization. It is clear that the author was trying his best, but was severely limited in what he could do by the rigid restraints of the film's script. Still, he managed to turn an under-average, what frankly should have been straight-to-DVD movie sequel, into an above-average science fiction novel – and that is by no means a mean feat.</p>
