            <p>The story follows the peaceful alien invasion of Earth by the mysterious <i>Overlords</i>, whose arrival begins decades of apparent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia - a community or society possessing near perfect qualities">utopia</a>, which however comes at the cost of human identity and culture.

            <p>Several attempts to adapt the novel into a screen form have been made without success.

            <p>It took more than 60 years, but <i>Childhood’s End</i> is finally getting its (small) screen adaptation.
