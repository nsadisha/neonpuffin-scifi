            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia) - the capital city of the United States of America">Washington, D.C.</a> is the capital of the United States of America. The city, located on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River" title="Potomac River - approximately 650 km long river flowing from the Potomac Highlands into the Chesapeake Bay">Potomac River</a>, bordering Maryland and Virginia, is the seat of the U.S. federal government as well as many important and influential international organisations.

Washington, D.C. is one of the most visited cities in the U.S., with over 20 million visitors in 2016 alone.</p>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_Wardman_Park" title="Washington Marriott Wardman Park - a (defunct) convention hotel located at 2600 Woodley Road NW, in the Woodley Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C.">Marriott Wardman Park Hotel</a> is a convention hotel located at 2600 Woodley Road NW, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodley_Park_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="Woodley Park - a neighborhood in Northwest, Washington, D.C., bordered on the east by the National Zoo and Rock Creek Park">Woodley Park</a> neighbourhood of Washington, D.C. The hotel, which features 195,000 square feet of event space with 95,000 square feet of exhibit space, multiple on-site restaurants, an outdoor pool, and over 1,000 hotel rooms, is big enough to handle everything visitors do at a Worldcon.

            <br/><h3>79th Worldcon – Programme highlights</h3>

            <br/><h4>Masquerade</h4>

            <p style="margin-top: -3px;">The Masquerade will be held on Saturday, 28th August 2021. The Worldcon Masquerade is a traditional judged costuming competition and stage show. As the tradition dictates, the entrants will be divided into individual categories based on the costuming skill levels of the participants, and judged by a semi-professional panel of judges. In light of the current pandemic, DisCon III  will be hosting a Virtual Masquerade, planned well in advance.  In the event that the convention can be held in person, a traditional Masquerade will be staged as well. This is a very popular event, and the demand will be high, therefore it is recommended to come early to reserve your seats.</p>

            <br/><h4>The 2021 Hugo Awards Ceremony</h4>

            <p style="margin-top: -3px;">As the pinnacle of the convention, The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award" title="Hugo Awards - prestigious awards given annually for the best science fiction and fantasy works of the previous year">Hugo Awards</a>, the prestigious awards for excellence in the field of science fiction and fantasy, recognising the best novels, stories, graphic stories, related works, dramatic presentations (i.e. film, television), artists, fanzines, fancasts and fan works for the past year, will be awarded on Friday, 27th August 2021.</p>

            <br/><h4>Programming</h4>

            <p style="margin-top: -3px;">As you might expect, DisCon III programme will consist of knowledgeable and articulate people interacting with each other and, via assorted panels, with the convention community on a variety of fascinating subjects about everything that falls under the very wide umbrella of science fiction, fantasy and horror: books, comics, television, films, science, writing, costuming, music, academic track, fandom, fan writing – and there are also programme items specifically designed for children.</p>
