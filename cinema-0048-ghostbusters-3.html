            <p><i>If there's something strange, in your neighbourhood, who you gonna call? If there's something weird, and it don't look good, who you gonna call?</i></p>
            <p>For a complete reboot of the <i>Ghostbusters</i> franchise, film director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feig" title="Paul S. Feig, American actor, screenwriter and director">Paul Feig</a> decided to call a cast of four female actresses: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Wiig" title="Kristen Carroll Wiig, American actress and comedienne">Kristen Wiig</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_McCarthy" title="Melissa Ann McCarthy, American actress and comedienne">Melissa McCarthy</a> of <i>Bridesmaids</i> fame, who will be joined by <i>Saturday Night Live’s</i> regular members <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_McKinnon" title="Kate McKinnon Berthold, American actress and comedienne">Kate McKinnon</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Jones_%28comedian%29" title="Leslie Jones, American actress and comedienne">Leslie Jones</a>.</p>
            <p>After the phenomenal success of the romantic comedy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaids_%282011_film%29" title="Bridesmaids, American romantic comedy film">Bridesmaids</a> with six women in the main cast, the film’s director <i>Paul Feig</i> decided to do the all-female <i>Ghostbusters</i> restart, as revealed in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> in 2014:</p>
            <p><i>“Ghostbusters is such a great thing and everybody knows it. It's a shame to just let this thing sit there. I was like, what if it was an all female cast? If they were all women? Suddenly, my mind kind of exploded: that would be really fun!”</i></p>
            <p>Feig added: <i>“I don’t want to do a shot by shot update of a movie that existed. It’s the difficult thing about remaking a great movie. So that’s why we’re not remaking a great movie. We’re doing our take on it.”</i></p>

            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live, American late-night live television comedy and variety show">Saturday Night Live</a> is a highly popular US television comedy and variety show, so it is hoped that its regulars, comediennes <i>Kate McKinnon</i> and <i>Leslie Jones</i> will help to inject the required silliness into the planned reboot.</p>
            <p>In the 1984 original <i>Ghostbusters</i>, the ghost-hunting quartet was portrayed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray" title="William James 'Bill' Murray, American actor and comedian">Bill Murray</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Aykroyd" title="Daniel Edward 'Dan' Aykroyd, Canadian actor, comedian and screenwriter">Dan Aykroyd</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Ramis" title="Harold Allen Ramis, American actor, screenwriter, and director">Harold Ramis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Hudson" title="Ernest Lee 'Ernie' Hudson, American actor">Ernie Hudson</a>, with <i>Aykroyd</i> and <i>Ramis</i> also co-writing the film.</p>
            <p>Directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Reitman" title="Ivan Reitman, Slovak-born Canadian film director and producer">Ivan Reitman</a>, the film was an instant critical and commercial success, grossing more than $295 million worldwide and spawning a huge franchise comprising television series, video games, comic books, action figures and even a theme park.</p>
            <p>A sequel, <i>Ghostbusters II</i> was released five years later in 1989 to a mixed reception, but still managed to make more than $215 million at the global box office on a relatively modest $37 million budget, making it a commercial success.</p>
            <p>Multiple plans for a third film in the series have been proposed ever since, with the script written, and then rewritten, several times, but appeared to have been hampered by <i>Bill Murray's</i> reluctance to star in the sequel.</p>
            <p><i>Harold Ramis's</i> death in 2014 seemed to make the <i>Ghostbusters III</i> an even unlikelier prospect. <i>Ivan Reitman</i> later ruled himself out as a director of the film, but stated that he would remain onboard as the producer.</p>
            <p><i>Paul Feig’s</i> involvement gave new momentum to the project and, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment" title="Sony Pictures Entertainment, American entertainment subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony">Sony's</a> blessing to reboot the franchise, the film is scheduled to start shooting in mid 2015 in <i>New York City</i>. At the moment, very little is known about the storyline, but <i>Feig</i> indicated that there will be no connection to the first two <i>Ghostbusters</i> films, as he doesn’t want to ruin the memory of the original franchise. He however didn’t rule out any original cast cameo roles.</p>
            <p><i>Ghostbusters</i> (if that's how it's going to be called) has a planned release date of 22 July 2016.</p>
