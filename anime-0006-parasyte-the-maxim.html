            <p><i>arasyte</i> (in Japanese, <i>Kiseiju Sei no Kakuritsu</i>, literally <i>‘Parasitic Beast’</i>) is a science fiction horror manga series written and illustrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitoshi_Iwaaki" title="Hitoshi Iwaaki, Japanese manga artist">Hitoshi Iwaaki</a>, and published from 1988 to 1995. The manga series was recently adapted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_%28company%29" title="Madhouse - a Japanese animation studio">Madhouse</a> into a 24-episode anime television series under the name <i>Parasyte -the maxim-</i>.</p>

            <p>The story centres on a 17-year-old boy <i>Shinichi Izumi</i>, who lives with his parents in a quiet suburbia of Tokyo. One night, a rain of spores pours down on Earth, and from the spores, worm-like parasitic creatures emerge, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their hosts’ ears or noses. After the parasite reaches the brain of its host, it completely takes control of the body of the infected individual. The parasite then spreads also to the remainder of the host’s body.</p>
            <p>While the resulting organism retains the outward appearance of an ordinary human being, it is now in effect a parasite in its adult stage – an otherworldly alien being with shape-shifting abilities, super-strength, lightning-speed reflexes, near invulnerability, and particular penchant for human flesh.</p>
            <p>One night, while <i>Shinichi</i> sleeps, one of the parasites in its larval stage attempts to crawl into his ear, but fails to do so as <i>Shinichi</i> is wearing earphones, so enters his body by burrowing itself into his right arm instead. Because the parasite is unable to travel further up and into <i>Shinichi’s</i> brain, it becomes trapped in <i>Shinichi’s</i> hand. Both beings therefore retain their respective intellect and personality and become in effect two separate individuals trapped in one body.</p>
            <p><i>Shinichi</i> at first refuses to accept his ordeal, even attempts to cut off his <i>‘alien’</i> hand, but gradually comes to realise that he is not prepared to part with his appendage, furthermore, that his shape-shifting super-limb gives him a certain leverage (the hand can grow eyes, mouth, or even transform itself into a lethal razor-sharp axe-like weapon, at will). Calling his new partner <i>‘Migi’</i> (Japanese word for <i>‘right’</i>), <i>Shinichi</i> forms, at first very uneasy, alliance with his uninvited <i>‘lodger’</i> and attempts to get on with his normal day-to-day life despite his new condition.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this is not to be, as other parasites keep coming after <i>Shinichi</i> & <i>Migi</i> to protect their sinister secret as they continue on their human-devouring spree and even start replacing key figures in government and public life with their own kind. As the duo encounter other parasites, they capitalise on their peculiar symbiosis and gradually form a strong bond, working together in order to survive. As <i>Shinichi’s</i> brain remains unaffected, he retains his empathy and intelligence, which qualities, when combined with <i>Migi’s</i> super-strength and super-fast reflexes, give them an edge in battling other parasites who frequently attack the pair upon realisation that <i>Migi</i> failed to take control of <i>Shinichi’s</i> brain. <i>Shinichi</i> feels compelled to fight other parasites, who regard humans as nothing more than a food source, while <i>Migi</i>, who is unable to feel any empathy for either <i>Shinichi</i> or other humans and is driven merely by self-preservation, has no other choice but to join in the fight, as he cannot survive without his human host and <i>Shinichi’s</i> death would also mean its own demise.</p>

                Shinichi must find a way to peacefully coexist with Migi, alien parasite which has taken over his right hand, in order to fight other carnivorous parasitic creatures.
            </div>

            <p><i>Shinichi</i> must not only find a way to peacefully coexist with <i>Migi</i>, the parasite which has taken over his right hand, but also reconcile his desire to protect his own kind from the invasion of alien parasites, with the necessity to keep his own parasite a secret in order to avoid being either killed or used as a laboratory specimen. Like a superhero with a secret identity, <i>Shinichi</i> must also find an excuse to explain away his parasite-enhanced super-human abilities, as well as the sudden change in his behaviour, to his family and friends.</p>
            <p>The relationship that suffers the most is <i>Shinichi’s</i> friendship with <i>Satomi Murano</i>, who is at first <i>Shinichi’s</i> best friend and later becomes his romantic interest. The two develop a great fondness for each other over the course of the series, but the progress of their relationship is hampered by <i>Shinichi’s</i> dread that his monstrous secret will be revealed, and <i>Satomi’s</i> fear of <i>Shinichi’s</i> secretive behaviour and mood swings caused by small traces of the parasite’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) - a molecule carrying most of the genetic instructions used in the functioning, growth and reproduction of all known living organisms">DNA</a> working their way through his body and slowly altering his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome" title="Genome - the genetic material of an organism consisting of DNA or RNA">genome</a>, as well as from the trials and tribulations of his life that has been suddenly turned upside down.</p>

                A parasite in its adult stage retains the outward appearance of a regular human being, but can shape-shift at will to a callous alien being that feeds on human flesh.
            </div>

            <p>Throughout the series, the unlikely tandem of <i>Shinichi</i> & <i>Migi</i> must face increasingly more powerful parasites and challenges which they overcome only if they will put behind their differences as two completely alien species and pull together as one body united in common cause.</p>
