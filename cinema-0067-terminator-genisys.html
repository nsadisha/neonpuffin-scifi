                The film opens with the leader of the Resistance, John Connor, launching a decisive offensive against Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence seeking to eliminate the human race by the use of Terminators.
            </div>

            <p>Let’s get one thing straight right at the beginning – despite serious shortcomings, <i>Terminator Genisys</i> is not <i><b>that</b></i> bad and many of the undeservedly negative reviews and ridiculously low scores are result of chronic nostalgia of some old geezers stuck in the past. In fact, should the first three films in the series were never made (I choose to completely ignore the awful <i>Terminator Salvation</i>), <i>Terminator Genisys</i> would be probably an excellent film.</p>
            <p>The problems is, they <i><b>were</b></i> made. And because of this, <i>Terminator Genisys</i> not only doesn’t bring anything new, original or noteworthy to the genre, but also ends up replaying the thousand-times seen action scenes, hundred-times played out scenarios and dozen-times heard gags, the first three films of the franchise became so notorious for.</p>

            <br class="clear" /> <!----- Important for layout ------>

            <p style="margin-top:0px;">In line with what <i>Paramount</i> announced will be a <i>‘total reboot’</i> of the franchise, <i>Terminator Genisys</i> begins similarly to the 1984 original, <i>The Terminator</i>, and follows <i>Kyle Reese</i>, a resistance fighter in the war against the machines controlled by the worldwide artificial intelligence <i>Skynet</i>, as the leader of the Resistance <i>John Connor</i> sends him back in time from 2029 to 1984 to protect his mother, <i>Sarah Connor</i>, from <i>Skynet’s Terminators</i>.</p>

            <p>The film then diverges as <i>Reese</i> finds out that, in this timeline, someone has been sending <i>Terminators</i> willy-nilly back through time. So in addition to the original <i>T-800</i> sent to 1984 to kill <i>Sarah Connor</i>, another <i>Terminator</i>, this time <i>T-1000</i>, was apparently sent to 1973 to kill <i>Sarah</i> when she was still a child, because it was too hard to kill her as an adult. But then someone sent <i>Guardian</i> – a reprogrammed <i>T-800</i> instructed to protect <i>Sarah</i>, who foiled the assassination attempt (though came too late to save <i>Sarah’s</i> father), and this <i>ex-Terminator</i> then raised <i>Sarah</i>, who affectionately named him <i>‘Pops’</i>, to the hardened and fearsome warrior she later became.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_black align_left" style="text-align: left; max-width: 902px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->

                T-800, the original model of Skynet’s Terminator makes his re-appearance in Terminator Genisys, as does the far more advanced shape-shifting T-1000.
            </div>

            <p>Additionally, <i>Skynet</i> has also sent another <i>T-1000</i> (played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Byung-hun" title="Lee Byung-Hun, South Korean actor">Lee Byung-Hun</a>) to intercept <i>Kyle Reese</i> when he arrives in 1984, with <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Pops</i> somehow anticipating his arrival and waiting ready to assist <i>Kyle</i>.</p>

                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>And, as this wasn’t already complicated enough, back in the year 2029, just as <i>Kyle Reese</i> makes his jump to 1984, a young recruit named <i>Alex Wright</i> (portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_%28actor%29" title="Matthew Robert 'Matt' Smith, English actor">Matt Smith</a>) reveals himself as <i>T-5000</i> – a highly advanced <i>Terminator</i> and the embodiment of <i>Skynet</i>, who infiltrated the Resistance, and – wait for it – transforms <i>John Connor</i> by a mere touch (through some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanorobotics" title="Nanorobotics - an emerging engineering discipline of designing and building machines whose components are at the scale of a nanometre">nanobot</a> trickery, apparently), to yet another model of <i>Terminator</i> – half-human-half-robot <i>T-3000</i>, who is then sent to 2014 to take a job at <i>Cyberdyne Systems</i> in order to develop and protect <i>Skynet</i> (which by now goes under the name <i>Genisys</i> – clearly just to confuse everybody) from <i>Sarah Connor</i> and <i>Kyle Reese</i> who time-travel to 2017 where (or rather <i>when</i>) they reunite with <i>Guardian</i> (who just hangs around all those 33 years) to try and destroy <i>Genisys</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computers - computers used primarily by large organizations for critical applications">mainframe</a> located at <i>Cyberdyne Systems</i>. (Even though <i>Sarah Connor</i> originally planned to travel to the year 1997 to prevent <i>Skynet</i> from becoming self-aware, it took less than 5 minutes of persuasion by <i>Kyle Reese</i>, a total stranger to her, to change her mind and go along with his plan to travel to the year 2017 instead – apparently, due to the warning <i>Kyle</i> received in his childhood vision, telling him that <i>Genisys</i> <i><b>is</b></i> <i>Skynet</i> and it will come online in 2017).</p>

                Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) trying to shake off the shape-shifting T-1000 (portrayed by Lee Byung-Hun) sent by Skynet to intercept and kill Kyle on his arrival from the year 2029.
            </div>

            <p>The final showdown in <i>Cyberdyne’s</i> headquarters sees <i>Sarah, Kyle</i> and <i>Guardian</i> doing their best to prevent <i>Genisys</i> from coming online, and <i>John-Connor-cum-T-3000</i> doing his worst to stop them stopping him. In the end, good guys win, bad guys lose and <i>Cyberdyne’s</i> headquarters are destroyed in a massive explosion putting an end to <i>Genisys/Skynet</i>. By a sheer stroke of luck, the remnants of nearly-destroyed <i>Guardian</i> get thrown into a puddle of <i>mimetic polyalloy</i>, upgrading him from the old, rusty <i>T-800</i> to a brand-new, shiny <i>T-1000</i>. The trio travels to <i>Kyle’s</i> childhood home, where <i>Kyle</i> tells his younger self about <i>Genisys</i> as a fail-safe measure to ensure that the timeline will be maintained and the events leading to his arrival from 2029 via 1984 to 2017 will repeat. <i>Sarah, Kyle</i> and <i>Guardian</i> then drive off into the country, where they live happily ever after…</p>

            <br class="clear" /> <!----- Important for layout ------>

            <p style="margin-top:0px;">…but wait a minute – if in this timeline <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Kyle</i> did not have sex in 1984, that would mean <i>John Connor</i> was never born (or, even if they – as <i>Pops</i> tactfully put it – eventually <i>‘mated’</i> in 2017, <i>John</i> would be in the year 2029 a mere 12-year-old boy, which would hardly make for a viable leader of the Resistance), so he would neither lead any offensive against <i>Skynet</i>, nor he would have sent <i>Kyle Reese</i> back in time to protect <i>Sarah</i>, and none of the above, or come to that, none of the events of the previous films, would have ever happened, right? <i><b>Right???</b></i></p>
            <p><i><b>Wrong</b></i>. <i>Paramount Pictures</i> cares little about such trifling minutiae, and green-lit two additional sequels to <i>Terminator Genisys</i> long before the film even opened in cinemas, because all rights to the <i>Terminator</i> franchise are set to revert back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Francis Cameron, Canadian filmmaker">James Cameron</a> in the year 2019 (as <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/docs/203.html" title="Termination of Transfers and Licenses Under 17 U.S.C. §203">copyright reversion</a> takes place after 35 years). Consequently, the <i>‘suits’</i> at <i>Paramount</i> are determined to squeeze as much money as possible out of the franchise before this happens – and nothing is going to stop them from doing so – not even a messed-up timeline or two.</p>

                “Old – not obsolete. Not yet.” – utters Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of T-800 / Guardian. Ultimately, the critics and audiences will be the judge of that.
            </div>

            <p>So, if you are new to the <i>Terminator</i> universe, and the above described events didn’t confuse the living hell out of you, go and see <i>Terminator Genisys</i> – the likelihood is, you will enjoy it. But if you are a die-hard fan of the franchise, cherishing your fond memories from the <i>‘core’</i> films of the <i>Terminator</i> saga, consider spending your money on something else instead.</p>

            <p>A mid-credits scene reveals that the main core of <i>Genisys</i> was located in a secret subterranean vault and has survived the destruction of <i>Cyberdyne’s</i> headquarters, paving way for the two planned sequels scheduled for release in 2017 and 2018, with the main cast including <i>Matt Smith</i> and <i>Arnold Schwarzenegger</i> already confirmed to return for the first sequel.</p>
