            <p>It seems that the science fiction genre has never had it so good. Herein lie some of the most anticipated sci-fi films of 2018 lined up for your perusal in the order of their release. Inevitably, some of this year’s movies will yet turn out to be just overblown high-flying balloons that quickly pop (or rather fizzle out) and fade out to obscurity, but otherwise everything indicates that 2018 will be a great year for science fiction cinema.</p>

Unfortunately, as with the above videogame-to-film adaptation, the trace went cold since then, however in an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN" title="IGN (Imagine Games Network) - a San Francisco–based games and entertainment media company">IGN</a> in March 2016 <i>J. J.

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass Effect</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare" title="BioWare - a video game developer located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada">BioWare’s</a> critically-acclaimed science fiction video game series, which so far runs into three instalments, with the fourth one, <i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i>, released recently, doesn’t need an introduction. The series, which is highly regarded for its detailed universe, thorough narrative, professional voice acting, character development and player’s in-game-choice effect on the overall experience, spawned several novels, a multitude of rather good comics (such as <a href="comic-0002-mass-effect-foundation.html" title="Mass Effect: Foundation - 13-issue comic book series written by Mac Walters, lead writer of the 'Mass Effect' video games">Mass Effect: Foundation</a>) and one anime film to date. The live-action film adaptation of the video game is rumoured to be in production at least since May,2010, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts" title="Electronic Arts Inc. - an American video game company headquartered in Redwood City, California">Electronic Arts</a> announced that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_Entertainment" title="Legendary Entertainment (a.k.a. Legendary Pictures) - an American media company based in Burbank, California">Legendary Pictures</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. - an American entertainment company, film studio and film distributor headquartered in Burbank, California">Warner Bros.</a> acquired the rights to a <i>Mass Effect</i> film, that would follow the plot of the original game, and that would be executive produced by <i>BioWare’s</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Muzyka" title="Ray Muzyka, Canadian investor, entrepreneur and a co-founder of video game developer BioWare">Ray Muzyka</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Zeschuk" title="Gregory P. 'Greg' Zeschuk, former VP at Electronic Arts, General Manager at BioWare Austin and a co-founder of video game developer BioWare">Greg Zeschuk</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Hudson" title="Casey Hudson, Canadian video game developer and project director of the Mass Effect trilogy">Casey Hudson</a> (however, their involvement in the film adaptation is now highly unlikely, as all three left BioWare to pursue other projects). Alas, there have been no new announcements on the matter since October 2012, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety - a weekly American entertainment trade magazine and website owned by Penske Media Corporation">Variety</a> announced that <i>Morgan Davis Foehl</i> would be writing the screenplay for the film adaptation, although according to film producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Arad" title="Avi Arad, Israeli-American businessman and film producer">Avi Arad</a>, the film is still in the works and likely to debut in 2018 or 2019.</p>

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Hole</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only a few of you will likely remember this sci-fi film directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Nelson_(director)" title="Gary Nelson, American television and film director">Gary Nelson</a>, produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company - multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate, headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California">Walt Disney Productions</a> and released in 1979 – the same year as <i>Ridley Scott’s</i> seminal science fiction masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)" title="Alien - a 1979 British-American science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott, first film in the Alien franchise">Alien</a>. And no wonder. There is nothing memorable about this dreadful excuse of a film. But it is only <i>‘after’</i> you compare these two films side-by-side when it becomes apparent just how revolutionary <i>Alien</i> truly was – and just how bad <i>‘The Black Hole’</i> really is. For example, take the humanoid android <i>Ash</i> from the <i>Alien</i>, and compare it to the vacuum-cleaner-resembling robot <i>V.I.N.CENT</i> from <i>The Black Hole</i> – do I need to continue? Plans to remake the film were toyed with at least since November 2009, when <i>Disney</i> revealed that it wants to re-imagine the movie for a new generation of cinemagoers and selected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kosinski" title="Joseph Kosinski, American television commercial and feature film director best known for his computer generated imagery">Joseph Kosinski</a> (<i>Tron: Legacy</i>) to direct the film. Later, in April 2013, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spaihts" title="Jon Spaihts, American film screenwriter">Jon Spaihts</a> (who wrote the original screenplay to <i>Alien’s</i> prequel, <i>Prometheus</i>), was confirmed as a script writer for the remake. Then, after a three-year hiatus, in 2016, it was announced that the film’s development was put on hold, because <i>Spaihts’s</i> script was considered by Disney <i>“too dark for a Disney movie”</i>, after which <i>Spaiths</i> was quoted to have commented on this thus: <i>“I loved that script, [But] it sits uneasily in Disney’s world as a dark epic, and Disney is a very colorful place.”</i>, before adding: <i>“I sure wrote a heck of a movie and was thrilled to do it. It was very faithful to the original but clever in all the ways that the first film was silly, I hope.”</i> The future of the project remains uncertain at the present.</p>
