            <br/><br/><p>The 72nd <i>World Science Fiction Convention</i>, also known as <a href="http://www.loncon3.org/" title="Loncon 3, The 72nd World Science Fiction Convention">Loncon 3</a>, was held from Thursday 14 to Monday 18 August 2014 at <i>ExCeL</i> Exhibition Centre in London and <b><a style="color:#666666">SCIFI</a>4<a style="color:#666666">EVER</a></b> was there to join in the celebration of science fiction and bring you the highlights of the show.</p>

            <p><i>Loncon 3</i> made history with almost 8,000 attending paying members and over 10,000 total registrations, being the most attended <i>Worldcon</i> in 75 years of World Science Fiction Conventions.</p>

            <p>With over 1000 programme items on the offer, it was not possible to attend them all (even with our teleportation abilities), but we have done our best to cover at least the most important and most interesting ones. This is how we spent the weekend:</p>

            <br/><h4>Thursday, 14 August</h4>

            <p class ="paragraph_header_first"><b><a style="color:#666666">15:00</a>&nbsp; A Conversation with George R. R. Martin, Connie Willis and Paul Cornell</b></p>

            <p>We were supposed to join <i>Paul Cornell</i> as he interviewed and ignited conversation with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin" title="American novelist George R. R. Martin">George R. R. Martin</a> and <i>Connie Willis</i>. Alas, we did not get in - the room was so packed, that people were sitting even on the floor in the aisles between the rows of chairs. A few years ago, barely anybody have heard of <i>George R. R. Martin</i> and his books. Now, thanks to the <i>HBO</i> adaptation of his series of epic fantasy novels <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> into the hugely successful television series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones" title="Fantasy drama TV series Game of Thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, he became an international super-celebrity, complete with entourage of personal assistants and bodyguards.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">19:00</a>&nbsp; Understanding Steampunk</b></p>

            <p>This was the first panel that we have attended. The panellists started with explaining the origins of this popular subgenre, which has grown into an entire new subculture, before moving on to scrutinising how has <i>steampunk</i> evolved, diversified, and differentiated itself from <i>'traditional'</i> science fiction. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk" title="Steampunk (sub-genre of science fiction)">Steampunk</a> has come a long way since the early days when most of the stories have taken place in Victorian London.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_white align_right" style="text-align: left; width: 892px; margin-bottom:20px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->
                <img src="images_expos/expo0002-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid black;" />
                The panellists Gillian Redfearn, Kaja Foglio, Kim Lakin-Smith, Oliver Plaschka and Marian Womack discussed the evolution of the Steampunk subgenre.
            </div>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">19:30</a>&nbsp; You got your SF in my Anime!</b></p>

            <p>Many events were overlapping and we wanted to see as many interesting ones as possible, therefore we sneaked out from the previous panel 30 minutes earlier, just in time to catch the second half of this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime" title="Japanese animations a.k.a. 'Anime'">Anime</a>-orientated discussion. The panellists made an interesting point in saying that what characterises <i>Sci-Fi Anime</i> is the willingness of the genre (or medium, as one of the panellists insisted <i>Anime</i> should be defined as) to explore controversial themes and readiness to go into subjects that would be difficult to venture into in live-action films. The panellists also opined that the <i>'twelve-episodes one-season at-a-time'</i> format assures that <i>Anime</i> series get funded more readily than longer-running shows.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_white align_right" style="text-align: left; width: 892px; margin-bottom:8px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->
                <img src="images_expos/expo0002-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid black;" />
                Sarah Ash, Juan Sanmiguel, Lars Adler, Django Wexler and Laura Mauro argued that Anime is better suited to explore difficult subjects and controversial themes.
            </div>

            <p>Incidentally, when the absence of <i>Anime</i> on British television was discussed during the questions & answers, one of the people in the audience pointed out that, a few years back, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ross" title="English TV presenter Jonathan Ross">Jonathan Ross</a> did some heavy lobbying to realise broadcasting of <i>Anime</i> programs on mainstream UK television - the same <i>Jonathan Ross</i>, who, along with his wife, was subjected to a rather vicious campaign on Twitter by a few disgruntled members of the fandom, after it was announced that he will be hosting the <a href="hugo-awards-2014.html" title="2014 Hugo Awards, presented at 72nd Worldcon">2014 Hugo Awards</a>.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">20:00</a>&nbsp; How to Survive</b></p>

            <p>To a palpable disappointment of the audience, this panel wasn’t about <i>'How to survive a zombie apocalypse'</i>, though it featured <i>'zombies'</i> - the codename which certain military circles apparently use to describe populace exposed to radiation after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust" title="Nuclear Holocaust a.k.a. Nuclear Apocalypse">nuclear holocaust</a>. These <i>'living dead'</i> would be, en-masse, fleeing the affected areas looking for a safe haven, and being in urgent need of food, water and medicine, would stop at nothing to get it. Providing you would be one of the <i>'lucky ones'</i> who avoided radiation exposure and have enough supplies to survive the impending <i>'nuclear winter'</i>, what would you do? If you will give them your resources, you will miss them later and these <i>'zombies'</i> will die anyway from radiation poisoning within a fortnight - have your shotgun at ready.</p>

                If you will be one of the ‘lucky ones’ who avoided radiation exposure, will you share your scarce supplies with those who will soon die from radiation poisoning?
            </div>

            <p>Moving on to the long-term issues of rebuilding the destroyed civilisation, did you know that in the whole world, there is not a single person who knows how to manufacture a humble lead pencil from the scratch? No, us either. In his book <i>'The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch'</i> <i>Lewis Dartnell</i>, one of the panellists, explains that the human knowledge is collective, distributed across the population. As it has been built slowly layer-by-layer over the centuries, it gradually became more and more specialised. Nowadays, most of us can operate a computer or smartphone, yet are completely ignorant of the fundamental principles of the civilization that supports us. We happily utilise the latest - as well as the most basic - technologies, without having the slightest idea of how they came to be and how and why they work. If we had to go back to the absolute basics, in some sort of post-apocalyptic scenario, would we know how to re-create an internal combustion engine, assemble a microscope, get metals out of rock, accurately tell time, weave fibres into clothing, or even how to produce basic foodstuffs for ourselves?</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header_first"><b><a style="color:#666666">11:00</a>&nbsp; Reading: George R. R. Martin</b></p>

            <p>The event took place in the auditorium which has 5,000 seats, so this time nobody was left out. Having learned from the previous experience, we came early and secured front row seats, and we were rewarded by reading from unabridged version of <i>George R. R. Martin’s</i> forthcoming book <i>The World of Ice & Fire</i>. Martin explained that, far from suffering from writer’s block, he has a completely opposite problem, that is, he cannot stop writing. His original intention was to write a handful of sideline texts for his latest book in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire" title="Series of epic fantasy novels 'A Song of Ice and Fire'">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> series, that would explain the background of characters, places, events, etc… However, the material for the sidelines grew quickly into tens of thousands of words, until <i>Martin</i> decided to publish these as a separate book, titled <i>The World of Ice & Fire: The Untold History of Westeros and the Game of Thrones</i>. This lavishly illustrated coffee table book is a comprehensive history of the <i>Seven Kingdoms</i>, containing among other material, full-colour artwork, maps of <i>Westeros</i>, family trees for Houses <i>Targaryen, Stark and Lannister</i>, history and culture of <i>Westeros</i> as well as accounts of the bitter rivalries, daring rebellions and epic battles that lead to the events of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>.</p>

            <p><i>George R. R. Martin</i> turned out to be as good a reader as he is a writer and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience of being read to from our favourite book by the master storyteller himself.</p>

            <p>In the questions & answers at the end of the reading <i>Martin</i> expressed his satisfaction with <i>HBO’s</i> adaptation of his epic series of books. Answering another question, he said that he might consider returning to writing science fiction stories, but his immediate focus and priority is on finishing the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> fantasy series.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">12:00</a>&nbsp; SKYLON and spaceflight of the future</b></p>

            <p>Moving from science fiction to science reality (or science possibility), this presentation by <a href="http://www.bis-space.com/" title="British Interplanetary Society">British Interplanetary Society</a> (<i>BIS</i>) described the (hypothetical) single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) <i>SKYLON</i> vehicle and its <i>SABRE</i> engines (the only part of the spaceship currently in development). The case for <i>SKYLON</i> has been made by the veteran of British Space Programme <i>Alan Bond</i>, managing director of <a href="http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/" title="Reaction Engines Ltd, developers of the SABRE engine">Reaction Engines Ltd</a>.</p>

                SKYLON spaceplane could prove to be a real game-changer in cheap transportation of both payload and passengers to the low Earth orbit and beyond.
            </div>

            <p>Presentation started with a brief history of reusable space vehicles, before moving to explaining the major advantages of the proposed <i>SKYLON</i> SSTO spaceplane. These are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>100% Reusability</li>
                <li>Minimal maintenance (the vehicle should, theoretically, fly in two-day intervals)</li>
                <li>Highly economical running costs (projected at 2-5% of today’s values)</li>
                <li>Horizontal take-off and horizontal landing</li>
                <li>Can transport payload up to 15 tonnes (satellites, supplies for the space station)</li>
                <li>Can transport passengers (in self-contained modules placed inside the cargo bay)</li>
            </ul>

                Alan Bond presented his vision of an On-Orbit Assembly that could be used to build large interplanetary spaceships from modules transported by SKYLON.
            </div>

            <p><i>Alan Bond</i> also reported on the current status of the <i>SABRE</i> engine development programme and outlined the major objectives and milestones of the planned development programme over the next couple of decades. These are as follow:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>SKYLON spaceplane, if completed, could prove to be a real game-changer in cheap transportation of both payload and passengers to the low Earth orbit</li>
                <li>This could help to extend the lifespan of the aging International Space Station (ISS) and further capitalise on this mind-boggling, 100-billion dollar investment</li>
                <li>By utilising SKYLON spaceplane, a huge space assembly can be built in the low Earth orbit (either by extending the existing ISS, or as an entirely new structure)</li>
                <li>This space assembly, or hangar, can be then used to build large spaceships (from modules transported by SKYLON) for missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond</li>
                <li>If everything goes according to the plan, SKYLON spaceplane could be in operation in late 2020s with Mars missions following soon after, in 2030s or 2040s</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During the presentation, <i>Alan Bond</i> also introduced Cosmonaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Artsebarsky" title="Cosmonaut Anatoly Pavlovich Artsebarsky">Anatoly Pavlovich Artsebarsky</a>, a veteran of the Russian (i.e. former USSR) space programme who flew aboard <i>Soyuz TM-12</i> (along with British astronaut <i>Helen Sharman</i>) and spent 5 months aboard <i>Mir Space Station</i>.</p>

            <p>After leaving <i>BIS’s</i> inspiring presentation, we spent some time in the Exhibits Hall.

            <p>We were prepared for an amateur experimental film, but this feature exceeded all our worst expectations. We were told to hold on until the very end to fully appreciate the movie. We did. Now we cannot unsee what we have seen. Oh dear.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header_first"><b><a style="color:#666666">12:00</a>&nbsp; Signing: George R. R. Martin</b></p>

            <p>From the dozens of signings at <i>Loncon 3</i>, this was the one we were really looking forward to. The section of the convention reserved for stalls was teeming with sellers offering fantasy and science fiction books, including a small outlet of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Planet_%28bookstore%29" title="Forbidden Planet (science fiction, fantasy and horror bookshop chain)">Forbidden Planet</a>, but looking for the <i>Game of Thrones</i> was like looking for strawberries in the winter (in woods that is, not in <i>Tesco</i>). We eventually bought a beautiful hardback version of the third book of the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> series <i>A Storm of Swords</i> with an intention to have it autographed. We came to the place of signing 30 minutes earlier, only to be told that the queue started to form at 9:00 in the morning, now has 200 people in it, and no more are allowed.</p>

                Alas, this is not <b>our</b> book being signed by George R. R. Martin.
            </div>

            <p>We understand that <i>George R. R. Martin’s</i> managers don’t want to devaluate his signature, but this was a big letdown. Sure, half of the people in that queue will probably put the signed book on <i>eBay</i> the following day, but not us. We are genuine and huge fans of the TV show as well as the original fantasy novels and having in our library a book from <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> signed by <i>George R. R. Martin</i> would mean the world to us. Jesus, this book is the size of the Bible and weighs about 5 kilos - and we had to carry it (<i>unsigned!</i>) around the <i>ExCeL</i> the whole day!</p>

            <p>At this workshop led by <i>Inko</i>, a celebrated <i>British Mangaka</i>, the participants learned how to draw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga" title="Japanese comics a.k.a. 'Manga'">Manga</a> way. Before <i>Inko</i> started with her demonstration, she made a small presentation of <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i> - a great source of <i>Manga</i> series, which at 500+ pages looks more like a telephone directory than a weekly magazine for youth, yet it sells for an equivalent of roughly £2. Eat your hearts out, British <i>Manga</i> fans!</p>

                Participants of the workshop learned how to draw the Manga way under the expert supervision of Inko, a celebrated British Manga artist.
            </div>

            <p>After this, <i>Inko</i> proceeded explaining what makes <i>Manga</i> style different from other art styles before drawing a basic <i>Manga</i> character, with the workshop participants invited to replicate the drawing following <i>Inko’s</i> instructions and under her expert guidance.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">14:00</a>&nbsp; An Interview with Chris Foss</b></p>

            <p>While <i>Ying</i> stayed with <i>Inko</i> to finish her <i>Manga</i> drawing, I left the previous panel 30 minutes earlier, to catch the second half of <i>Chris Foss’s</i> interview by a fellow artist <i>John Picacio</i>.</p>

            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Foss" title="British sci-fi illustrator Chris Foss">Chris Foss</a> discussed illustrating <i>The Joy of Sex</i> (an influential 1972 sex manual by British author <i>Alex Comfort</i>), before moving on to more sci-fi related themes, such as his collaboration with an enigmatic Chilean filmmaker <i>Alejandro Jodorowsky</i> on a proposed adaptation of <i>Frank Herbert's</i> venerated science fiction novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28franchise%29" title="Legendary sci-fi franchise Dune">Dune</a>. <i>Foss</i> recalls how he received, sometime in 1974, a call from Paris, inviting him to join a pre-production unit set up by <i>Jodorowsky</i> and consisting of him, <i>Jean Giraud (Moebius)</i>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger" title="Swiss surrealist artist and creator of 'Alien', H. R. Giger">H. R. Giger</a>.</p>

                "I am a cab driver of art" says veteran sci-fi artist Chris Foss, before continuing: "If someone asks me to paint a matchbox in space, and the price is right, I’ll do it!".
            </div>

            <p>As for the potential rivalry issues, <i>Foss</i> explained that there were none, as their roles were strictly divided: he was drawing spaceships and machines, <i>Moebius</i> characters and <i>Giger</i> scenery and buildings. <i>Foss</i> further recalls that no expenses were spared: the whole floor of the office block was hired for the film production, expensive drawing devices were purchased, luxurious hotel suites for the pre-production crew were paid for and opulent celebrities were offered major roles in the film. Surrealist artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD" title="Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dali">Salvador Dali</a> (who famously requested a fee of $100,000 per hour) was primed to portray <i>Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV</i> and <i>Orson Welles</i> (after some persuasion involving flying in his favourite gourmet chef to prepare his meals for him throughout the filming) accepted the role of <i>Baron Vladimir Harkonnen</i>. The music was supposed to be composed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd" title="English progressive rock band Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, after <i>Frank Herbert</i> travelled to Europe in 1976 to find that nearly $2 million of the film’s $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and saw <i>Jodorowsky's</i> phonebook-sized script, that would result in a 14-hour movie, the production of the film collapsed when no film studio could be found willing to fund the movie to <i>Jodorowsky's</i> terms. (<i>H. R. Giger’s</i> concept drawings for <i>Dune</i> later made it into <i>Ridley Scott’s</i> film <i>Prometheus</i>).</p>

            <p>During the jolly and informal conversation with <i>John Picacio</i>, veteran sci-fi artist <i>Chris Foss</i> also referred to himself as a <i>"cab driver of art"</i> and said that if someone asks him to paint a matchbox in space and the price is right, he will do it.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">15:00</a>&nbsp; The Philosophical Mecha</b></p>

            <p>Panel of four (<i>David G. Shaw, Madeline Ashby, Shaun Duke</i> and <i>Jade Ka</i>) discussed philosophical aspects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha" title="Japanese sci-fi subgenre centering on giant robots a.k.a. 'Mecha'">Mecha</a> subgenre. Is <i>Mecha</i> more than just the infantile stories about giant robots? Panellists certainly thought so and made some interesting points to further this argument. Since the wearers of gigantic robot suits are mostly coming-of-age orphans, aren’t the operators of giant robots like children encased in a giant metallic womb - always protected, forever juvenile and devoid of any responsibility?</p>

            <p>Maybe. And maybe the panellist who came up with this notion just reads too much into it. I personally found the proposal of another panellist more appealing.

            <p><i>George R. R. Martin's</i> work has been interpreted by a wide range of artists. Panellists, amongst them illustrators <i>John Picacio</i> and <i>Martina Pilcerova</i>, talked about how they met the author of <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> and how they approached the task of bringing their own vision to his science fiction and fantasy worlds. <i>Martina Pilcerova</i> described how she finished rendering the famous scene from <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, in which is <i>Bran Stark</i> pushed out of the window by <i>Jaime Lannister</i>, and showed it to <i>Martin</i>. Seeing the illustration, <i>Martin</i> remarked: <i>"It looks OK, but why is this one wearing armour?"</i> (i.e. <i>Jaime Lannister</i>) making a fair point and prompting her to repaint the scene with <i>Jaime Lannister</i> and <i>Cersei Lannister</i> naked. <i>Martina</i> also revealed that they (i.e. artists illustrating <i>George R.

            <p class ="paragraph_header_first"><b><a style="color:#666666">13:30</a>&nbsp; Starships Inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's Fiction</b></p>

            <p>Science Fiction was always a driving force for visions of future technologies and modes of transportation, to the extent that they can often lead to the realisation of those visions by a self-fulfilling prophesy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke" title="British sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> was a master in this field and his numerous stories describe various kinds of spacecraft and their propulsion systems.</p>

            <p>This presentation by <i>Initiative for Interstellar Studies (I4IS)</i> discussed the original and innovative ideas for space travel that are appearing throughout <i>A. C. Clarke's</i> science fiction stories and considered the real-life efforts to bring these ideas into reality so that the manned interstellar travel may one day be achieved.</p>

                BIS’s Lunar Spaceship 1938 concept design and NASA’s Eagle Apollo Lunar Module share some striking similarities in both appearance and design.
            </div>

            <p>Did you know, for example, that the 1938’s concept design of <i>BIS’s Lunar Spaceship</i> (<i>A. C. Clarke</i> was twice a chairman of <i>BIS</i>), and particularly its Lander, is strikingly similar to the <i>NASA’s Eagle Apollo Lunar Module</i>? (and not only by the appearance and design, they have many other common characteristics - both would carry a crew of three, for example). And did you know that <i>NASA</i> actually commissioned a feasibility study of a vehicle based on a fictional spaceship <i>Discovery One</i> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29" title="Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>?</p>

                From science fiction to science reality: Sunjammer, a 38x38 metre solar sail constructed by LGarde for NASA, was inspired by and named after A. C. Clarke’s story.
            </div>

            <p>The list goes on and on. Currently, <i>Sunjammer</i> - the largest <i>solar sail</i> to be deployed to date, is slated to launch in January 2015 atop a <i>SpaceX’s Falcon 9</i> rocket. <i>Sunjammer</i> was named after a 1964’s <i>A. C. Clarke</i> story of the same name (also known as <i>The Wind from the Sun</i>), in which several solar sails compete in a race across the Solar System.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">14:00</a>&nbsp; Starships in perspective</b></p>

            <p>In yet another panel presented by <i>I4IS</i>, the panellists presented some new and radical views on financing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_space_exploration" title="Deep space exploration projects">deep space exploration</a> projects. The sceptics and critics of interstellar travel argue that the vast sums of money required for the construction of interstellar spaceships mean that no government or state will be able to commit to such a huge undertaking now or in the future. Panellists however pointed out that the interstellar missions would be undertaken and financed by an economy on an entirely different scale – on the scale of our whole solar system, rather than on Earth’s scale.</p>

            <p>The humanity cannot continue taking their resources from the Earth’s crust endlessly. Sooner or later, these limited resources will become exhausted and we must start looking for the new places to get them from. <i>Moon</i> and <i>Asteroids</i> can provide iron, nickel, cobalt and a few other elements for the ever-growing Earth’s industry, while <i>Jupiter</i>, composed of 90% hydrogen, can serve as nigh on inexhaustible source of rocket propellant. The humanity will, sooner or later, start utilising resources and build economy on the scale of the entire solar system.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_white align_right" style="text-align: left; width: 892px; margin-bottom:8px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->
                <img src="images_expos/expo0002-20.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid black;" />
                Some argue that it will take financial and industrial capacity of the economy on the scale of the entire solar system to fund and launch interstellar space missions.
            </div>

            <p>At this point the depleted Earth’s resources and limited finances of Earth’s nation states will no longer be a limiting factor of human spaceflight and the will, as well as the necessary finances, for the interstellar expeditions will be found.</p>

            <p>One of the panellists also pointed out that the social and technological progress often comes in exponential leaps rather than through a gradual improvement. During the American <i>westward expansion</i> in the early 1800s, people spent 6 months travelling 2,000 miles in wagon trains to get to the rich new lands of the <i>West Coast</i>. By 1869, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad" title="United States First Transcontinental Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a> was completed, the same coast-to-coast journey could be done in mere 8 days. Nowadays, a trans-continental flight takes less than 6 hours in a jet airliner. Similarly, a game-changing technology could emerge that would dramatically reduce the amount of energy required for the space travel or considerably speed up travelling times between the stars.</p>

            <p class ="paragraph_header"><b><a style="color:#666666">14:30</a>&nbsp; Taking the Initiative - Why We Have To Start Planning for an Interstellar Future Now</b></p>

            <p>A continuation of the previous two panels, also presented by <i>I4IS</i>, this panel emphasised the need to start planning for our future in space now. Various organisations have set themselves a goal to launch a mission, be it manned or unmanned, to the stars within this century, but the planning for this must begin today. In the current climate of global warming, temperamental economy and regional conflicts, it is hard to imagine any government spending scarce resources on the development of new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit" title="Low Earth orbit (LEO)">near-Earth</a> space technologies, let alone building an interstellar spacecraft. But with huge challenges to be overcome in its construction, we must start planning now, as there might be neither the will nor the resources for a project on this scale in the uncertain future.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_white align_right" style="text-align: left; width: 892px; margin-bottom:8px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->

                I4IS says that we should start planning for our interstellar future now, as there might not be either the will or the resources for such ambitious projects in the future.
            </div>

            <p>In the questions & answers, one of the attendees (in my opinion quite correctly) pointed out that we are not even an <i>Interplanetary Civilisation</i>, let alone an <i>Interstellar Civilisation</i>, so in this sense are <i>I4IS</i> perhaps getting a bit ahead of themselves. Maybe we should take it step-by-step and first concentrate on our backyard, i.e. the Solar System, before we venture to the stars.</p>
