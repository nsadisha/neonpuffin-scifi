                After the Allies lost the World War II, United States are divided into ‘Greater Nazi Reich’ controlled by Nazi Germany in the east, and ‘Japanese Pacific States’ administered by Imperial Japan in the west.

            <p><i>The Man in the High Castle</i> television series opens, similarly to the novel, in 1962, fifteen years after the end of a fictional longer <i>World War II</i> (1939–1947), that was won by <i>Imperial Japan</i> and <i>Nazi Germany</i>, and concerns intrigues between these victorious <i>Axis</i> powers as they rule over the conquered United States, as well as daily lives of ordinary Americans living under the resulting totalitarian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism - a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that originated in Italy">Fascist</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Imperialism" title="New Imperialism - a period of colonial expansion by the European powers, the United States of America and the Empire of Japan during the late 19th and early 20th centuries">Imperialistic</a> rule.</p>
            <p>The storyline of the pilot episode starts in <i>New York City</i>, <i>Greater Nazi Reich</i>, in 1962. <i>Juliana Crain</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Davalos" title="Alexa Davalos, American actress">Alexa Davalos</a>) is a young woman living in <i>San Francisco</i> who is openly content with living under Japanese rule. She is friendly with Japanese people who settled in <i>San Francisco</i> and has even become an expert in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido" title="Aikido - a Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy and religious beliefs">Aikido</a>. All this despite her mother harbouring hatred of the Japanese, who killed her husband and <i>Juliana’s</i> father during the war. <i>Juliana’s</i> perfect world comes crashing down on her though, when her half-sister <i>Trudy</i> is killed by Japanese security forces after resisting arrest. Just before <i>Trudy</i> dies, she hands <i>Juliana</i> a film spool containing an eerily realistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsreel" title="Newsreel - a short documentary film containing filmed news stories, typically shown in cinemas prior the main feature film, prevalent in the first half of the twentieth century and into the 1960s">newsreel</a> depicting an alternate outcome of <i>World War II</i>, one in which the Allies won and Germany and Japan were defeated.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0px">The short film, titled <i>‘The Grasshopper Lies Heavy’</i>, is part of a whole series of similar documentaries said to have been created by someone referred to as <i>‘The Man in the High Castle’</i>. <i>Juliana</i> is intrigued, and after she learns that <i>Trudy</i> was carrying the newsreel to <i>Canon City</i>, capital of the <i>Rocky Mountain States</i>, she decides to travel to the <i>Neutral Zone</i> in <i>Trudy’s</i> place, to find out the truth behind the films and their enigmatic creator.</p>
