            <p class="shift_paragraph_up"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cartoon_Museum" title="The Cartoon Museum - a museum for cartoons, caricatures, comic strips and animation based in London, UK">The Cartoon Museum</a> in Holborn, London hosts an exhibition of original cover artwork that coincides with the reissue of some classic <i>Doctor Who</i> releases including the first seven Doctors by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Books" title="BBC Books - an imprint of Penguin Random House with BBC Worldwide as a minority shareholder">BBC Books</a>.</p>

            <p>In what is the first public display of the original artworks, the exhibition will feature over 30 pieces, including the covers from six of the new reissues, ten covers by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Achilleos" title="Chris Achilleos, Cyprus-born, UK-residing painter and illustrator specialising in fantasy artwork">Chris Achilleos</a> (from <i>'The Daleks'</i> through to <i>'Revenge of the Cybermen'</i>), five covers by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_novelisations#Illustrators" title="Andrew Skilleter, British artist who created much of the cover art for the Doctor Who books from 1979 to 1994">Andrew Skilleter</a> (from <i>'Destiny of the Daleks'</i> through to <i>'The Mark of the Rani'</i>) and other classic and well-known original cover artworks such as by <i>Roy Knipe, Jeff Cummins</i> and <i>David McAlister</i>. The original paintings feature likenesses of many famous actors playing the part of the <i>Doctor</i> over the years, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pertwee" title="John Devon Roland 'Jon' Pertwee, English actor best known for his role as the third incarnation of the Doctor in the science fiction series Doctor Who from 1970 and 1974">Jon Pertwee</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker" title="Thomas Stewart 'Tom' Baker, English actor best known for his role as the fourth incarnation of the Doctor in the science fiction series Doctor Who from 1974 to 1981">Tom Baker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Davison" title="Peter Davison (born Peter Malcolm Gordon Moffett), English actor best known for his role as the fifth incarnation of the Doctor in the science fiction series Doctor Who from 1981 to 1984">Peter Davison</a>, as well as many of the infamous <i>Doctor Who</i> adversaries such as <i>Daleks</i> and <i>Cybermen</i>.</p>
            <p>In the days before DVDs and VHS, the novelisations of <i>Doctor Who</i> TV episodes by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Books" title="Target Books - former British paperback-publishing imprint of Universal-Tandem Publishing Co Ltd, well known for novelisations based on the science fiction television series Doctor Who">Target Books</a> were sometimes the only way in which <i>Doctor Who</i> fans could re-enjoy some of the most iconic stories after they were broadcast on BBC. As a matter of fact, many fans of a certain age first experienced a great number of the <i>Time Lord’s</i> adventures for the first time through print, as opposed to television.</p>
            <p>One of such fans is <i>Doctor Who</i> writer and re-imagined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29" title="Sherlock - a British-American crime drama television series created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss which is a re-imagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 'Sherlock Holmes' detective stories">Sherlock</a> co-creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gatiss" title="Mark Gatiss, English actor, novelist, screenwriter and a member of the comedy team 'The League of Gentlemen'">Mark Gatiss</a>, who said to BBC: <br/><i>“To finally see some of these memorable covers in the flesh is a wonderful, unexpected treat. It’s a testament to their terrific, punchy immediacy that they feel both nostalgic and brand new. Show a copy of any one of these glorious novelisations to people of a certain age and they are transported back to a simpler, cosier age.”</i>.</p>
            <p>This is the very first time that the cover artwork has been publicly exhibited, so <i>Doctor Who</i> fans have an unique opportunity to finally see the original paintings which became the covers for this memorable range of books by <i>Target Books</i> imprint issued during 1970s and 80s.</p>
            <p><i>Doctor Who: The Target Books Artwork</i> exhibition takes place at <i>The Cartoon Museum</i>, 35 Little Russell Street, Holborn, London (the museum is located just a short walk from either Tottenham Court Road or Holborn underground station) from Thursday 28th April to Sunday 15th May.</p>
