            <p class="shift_paragraph_up">When <i>David</i> was 10 years old, his younger brother <i>Simon</i> disappeared. <i>David's</i> father told him that <i>Simon</i> was <i>"taken by aliens"</i>, and would not talk of it again, before drinking himself to death. Fast forward 25 years and <i>David</i> is spending all his free time and money talking on Internet to dozens of loonies and fraudsters who are willing to sell him <i>‘genuine’</i> information about the aliens. His quest takes him to many countries around the world, and he is willing to listen to anyone who has a story about <a href="cinema-0026-alien-abduction.html" title="Alien abductions such as in a low-budget film 'Alien Abduction'">alien abductions</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="UFO - acronym for Unidentified Flying Object">UFO</a> sightings. He however does not realise that <i>‘the truth’</i> is much closer than he thinks.</p>

            <p>This time I wasn’t disappointed as at the previous screening (<a href="cinema-0028-suicide-or-lulu-and-me-in-a-world-made-for-two.html" title="Low-budget film 'Suicide or Lulu and Me in a World Made for Two'">Suicide or Lulu and Me in a World Made for Two</a>). Despite being a low budget, this British science fiction comedy (with a few surprising cameos) raises more than a few laughs. The film is full of clever puns, less-than-subtle in-jokes and nods to countless sci-fi shows, such as when <i>David</i> promises the agent of the super-secret</p>
