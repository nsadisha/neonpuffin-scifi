            <p><i>20th Century Fox</i> is looking to bring back the iconic science fiction television series <i>The X-Files</i>.</p>
            <p>The original <i>X-Files</i>, revolving around the exploits of FBI Special Agents <i>Fox Mulder</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duchovny" title="David William Duchovny, American actor">David Duchovny</a>) and <i>Dana Scully</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Anderson" title="Gillian Leigh Anderson, American actress">Gillian Anderson</a>) investigating <i>X-Files</i>: cases involving alien abductions and paranormal phenomena, were broadcast for almost 10 years, running into 9 seasons and more than 200 episodes, before the show was cancelled in 2002. The television series was followed by two feature films: <i>‘The X-Files’</i> in 1998 and <i>‘The X-Files: I Want to Believe’</i> in 2008 as well as <i>‘The X-Files: Season 10’</i>, a 25-issue comic book series by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDW_Publishing" title="IDW Publishing, American publisher of comic books">IDW Publishing</a> in 2013.</p>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox_Television" title="20th Century Fox Television, television production division of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation">20th Century Fox Television</a> chairman <i>Gary Newman</i> confirmed that the network is in talks for a new instalment of <i>Chris Carter’s</i> cult sci-fi drama, which starred <i>David Duchovny</i> and <i>Gillian Anderson</i>. <i>Newman</i> said that he was hopeful about the outcome. The fellow <i>20th Century Fox Television</i> chairman <i>Dana Walden</i> confirmed this, adding that the talks so far have been only logistical, looking at windows when all the key <i>X-Files</i> players, i.e. creator <i>Chris Carter</i> and actors <i>David Duchovny</i> and <i>Gillian Anderson</i>, are available. She confirmed that a potential <i>X-Files</i> follow-up will star the original leading duo of <i>Duchovny</i> and <i>Anderson</i>, but stressed that there have been no detailed discussions yet what the new series might be about.</p>
            <p>Both <i>Duchovny</i> and <i>Anderson</i> expressed great interest in the project, with <i>Duchovny</i> saying: <i>“I’m more than happy and excited to bring it back and do it again with Gillian and Chris.”</i> He later added: <i>“I'm assuming that it will happen sooner rather than later now. We'll see what form, how many [episodes]. Certainly I can't, nor would I be interested, in doing a full season. It will be in some kind of limited form.”</i> <i>Duchovny</i> finished, laughing: <i>“We're all old, we don't have the energy for a full season.”</i></p>
            <p><i>Chris Carter</i>, creator of the original <i>X-Files</i> series, hinted at a possible reboot in the summer, acknowledging he had conversations with <i>20th Century Fox Television</i>.</p>
            <p>We want to believe...</p>
