            <p>The original <i>Blade Runner</i>, adapted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Fancher" title="Hampton Lansden Fancher, American actor, screenwriter and producer">Hampton Fancher</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Peoples" title="David Webb Peoples, American screenwriter">David Peoples</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" title="Philip Kindred Dick, American novelist best known for his science fiction works">Philip K. Dick’s</a> novel <i>“Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?”</i> which premiered in 1982, starred <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford, American actor">Harrison Ford</a> as <i>‘Blade Runner’ Rick Deckard</i>, a special agent of the Los Angeles police department hired to hunt down and <i>‘retire’</i> (i.e. exterminate) so-called <i>replicants</i> – androids, virtually indistinguishable from humans, which are manufactured by the powerful <i>Tyrell Corporation</i> for use on off-world colonies, but banned on Earth.</p>
            <p>The film, which saw <i>Harrison Ford</i> starring opposite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Hauer" title="Rutger Oelsen Hauer, Dutch actor">Rutger Hauer</a> playing <i>Roy Batty</i>, leader of a small group of the renegade <i>Nexus-6</i> replicants, initially polarised critics and performed poorly at the box office, but has since become a cult classic and, along with the <i>Alien</i>, one of the two most revered science fiction films by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott, English film director and producer">Ridley Scott</a>.</p>
            <p>And while <i>Alien</i> got since its release three, more-or-less successful sequels, with the fourth one, tentatively titled <a href="cinema-0050-alien-5-xeno.html" title="Alien: Xeno, 5th instalment in the Alien franchise">Alien: Xeno</a> already in the making, it’s been almost 33 years since <i>Blade Runner’s</i> premiere, with any sequel yet to be made.</p>
            <p>At least since 2007, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., American media company making film, television programs and music">Warner Bros.</a> released <i>‘Blade Runner - The Final Cut’</i>, a 25th anniversary digitally re-mastered version on which <i>Ridley Scott</i> had complete artistic freedom, <i>Scott</i> considered developing a follow-up film and made several announcements with regards to this, the last one in 2012, when he said: <i>“It’s not a rumour – it’s happening. With Harrison Ford? I don’t know yet. Is he too old? Well, he was a Nexus-6 so we don’t know how long he can live. And that’s all I’m going to say at this stage.”</i></p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_cinema/cinema0024-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:2px;" />

            <p>Now, at long last, the <i>Blade Runner</i> sequel has been officially confirmed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcon_Entertainment" title="Alcon Entertainment, American film production company">Alcon Entertainment</a>, with <i>Harrison Ford</i> set to reprise his role as <i>Rick Deckard</i> and with Academy Award nominee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Villeneuve" title="Denis Villeneuve, French-Canadian film screenwriter and director">Denis Villeneuve</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_%282013_film%29" title="Prisoners, American thriller film directed by Denis Villeneuve">Prisoners</a>) in negotiations to direct the follow-up.</p>
            <p><i>Ridley Scott</i>, who won’t be directing, but is returning as a co-producer, revealed that <i>Ford’s</i> character will only appear in the <i>third act</i> of the sequel and said about the film earlier:</p>
            <p class="largest" ><i>“Hampton Fancher and I talked at length about what it could be, and came up with a pretty strong three-act storyline, and it all makes sense in terms of how it relates to the first one.”</i></p>

            <p><i>Alcon Entertainment</i> acquired the film, television and ancillary franchise rights to <i>Blade Runner</i>, which is now generally regarded as one of the best science fiction films ever made, in 2011 from film producer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Yorkin" title="Bud Yorkin, American film and television director, screenwriter and producer">Bud Yorkin</a>, who will be co-producing the sequel.</p>
            <p>Film is scheduled to start principal photography in summer of 2016. Film screenwriter and producer <i>Hampton Fancher</i> (co-writer of the original <i>Blade Runner</i> film) and television and film scriptwriter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Green_%28writer%29" title="Michael Green, American television, film and comic book writer">Michael Green</a> (who is also working on a sequel to <i>Ridley Scott’s Prometheus</i>) have written the original screenplay based on the storyline by <i>Fancher</i> and <i>Scott</i> mentioned above.</p>
            <p><i>Alcon Entertainment’s</i> co-founders and CEOs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kosove" title="Andrew A. Kosove, American film producer">Andrew Kosove</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderick_Johnson" title="Broderick Johnson, American film producer">Broderick Johnson</a> announced on 26th February 2015:</p>
            <p><i>“We are honored that Harrison is joining us on this journey with Denis Villeneuve, who is a singular talent, as we experienced personally on Prisoners. Hampton and Michael, with Ridley Scott, have crafted a uniquely potent and faithful sequel to one of the most universally celebrated films of all time, and we couldn’t be more thrilled with this amazing, creative team.”</i></p>
            <p>How will this all eventually work out remains to be seen. <i>Alcon Entertainment</i> produced thus far only two science fiction films: <i>‘The Book of Eli’</i>, which has received mixed reviews from critics and <i>‘Transcendence’</i> which was not only a critical failure, but also flopped at the box office.</p>
