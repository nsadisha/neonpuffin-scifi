            <p>A popular joke about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_program" title="Soviet space program - space exploration programs conducted by the former Soviet Union (USSR)">Soviet space program</a> circulated during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race" title="Space Race - a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union and the United States for supremacy in spaceflight capability">Space Race</a> goes thus: <i>“We shouldn’t let Khrushchev go to the Moon – he would plant maize there.”</i> (reference to then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev - First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964">First Secretary’s</a> of the <i>Communist Party of the Soviet Union</i> harebrained schemes such as his insistence on massive expansion of the sown areas of maize, including environments clearly completely unsuitable for its growth, such as the inhospitable territories beyond the Arctic Circle). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="Matthew Paige 'Matt' Damon, American actor and filmmaker">Matt Damon’s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - United States government agency responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research">NASA</a> astronaut and botanist <i>Mark Watney</i> doesn’t get to plant corn on the Moon, but he gets to do the second best thing: growing potatoes on Mars – in his own shit.</p>

                Mark Watney (portrayed by Matt Damon) is one of six astronauts on a planned month-long NASA expedition on Mars…

            <p><i>The Martian</i>, similarly to <a href="cinema-0007-europa-report.html" title="Europa Report - science fiction film about a fictional mission to Europa, one of the moons of the planet Jupiter">Europa Report</a>, is one of those science fiction films that put more emphasis on <i>‘science’</i> than on fiction. The film, directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott, English film director and producer">Ridley Scott</a> is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir_%28writer%29" title="Andy Weir, American novelist">Andy Weir’s</a> best-selling novel of the same name. Before writing the book, <i>Weir</i> researched astronomy, orbital mechanics, the history of manned spaceflight and other related material in order to make the story, which is based on sound science and existing technology, as realistic as possible.</p>
            <p>When the <i>Ares III</i> manned mission to Mars is hit by an intense sand storm, and the crew is making their way to the orbit-return module, astronaut <i>Mark Watney</i> is carried away by a powerful gust of wind and gets separated from the rest of the crew. As his bio-monitor is damaged by a piece of flying debris that hits his spacesuit, he is presumed dead. Seeing that the lander is starting to lean dangerously to one side, threatening to cut off the only escape route, mission commander <i>Melissa Lewis</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Chastain" title="Jessica Michelle Chastain, American actress">Jessica Chastain</a>) makes a tough but logical decision to save the lives of the remaining members of the crew and gives orders to leave the planet, leaving <i>Watney</i> behind.</p>

                …when a dust storm forces the crew to abandon their base and cut their mission short, with Watney, hit by debris, blown away and presumed dead, left behind.
            </div>

            <p>While the rest of the crew aboard the lander dock in Mars orbit with the <i>Hermes</i> spacecraft and start their long journey back to Earth, <i>Watney</i> regains his consciousness after surviving the storm and finds himself abandoned on the surface of Mars. With only a few percent of oxygen reserves remaining in the life-support system of his spacesuit, he reaches the relative safety of the Mars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_outpost" title="Human outpost - artificially-created, controlled human habitat located in environment inhospitable for humans, such as on another planet">habitat</a>, though he is unable to contact <i>Hermes</i> or <i>NASA</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center" title="Mission control center - a facility that manages aerospace vehicle flights">mission control center</a> due to the destruction of hab’s communication equipment by the storm.</p>
            <p><i>Watney</i> soon realises that his only chance of returning to Earth is to wait out four long years after which the next manned mission, <i>Ares IV</i>, is scheduled to land on the planet. Unfortunately, he calculates that even with strict rationing he has only enough food to last for a quarter of that time. While rummaging through supplies, <i>Watney</i> happens upon a small bag of hermetically sealed potatoes and gets a life-saving idea. He uses his knowledge as a botanist to convert the biggest room of the habitat into an impromptu potato farm utilising Mars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith" title="Regolith - a layer of loose, heterogeneous material covering solid rock">regolith</a> fertilised with his, and his former crewmates’, faeces, and waters the crops by burning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine" title="Hydrazine - a colourless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odour (an inorganic compound with the chemical formula N2H4)">hydrazine</a> from the rocket engine thus producing hydrogen, which, when combined with oxygen in the hab’s atmosphere creates the much needed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water" title="Water - a hydrogen compound with the chemical formula H2O">H2O</a>. He also modifies the Mars rover to make it capable of long journeys, as the <i>Ares IV</i> landing site is seven months’ travel away.</p>

                With his supplies of food running low, Watney, by a stroke of luck a botanist, turns into a first Martian farmer and starts growing potatoes fertilised by his own faeces.

            <p>Back on Earth, while reviewing satellite photos of Mars, <i>NASA</i> engineer <i>Mindy Park</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Davis" title="Mackenzie Davis, Canadian actress">Mackenzie Davis</a>) notices that someone has cleaned the solar panels near the Mars habitat and realises that this can only mean one thing: astronaut <i>Mark Watney</i>, who was presumed dead, has in fact survived and is now stranded some 140 million miles from home. She tells senior <i>NASA</i> engineer <i>Venkat Kapoor</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor" title="Chiwetelu Umeadi 'Chiwetel' Ejiofor, British actor">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>) of her finding, and they immediately start looking for a way to re-establish contact with the stranded astronaut. Fearing that the revelation could negatively affect their morale, <i>NASA</i> director <i>Teddy Sanders</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Daniels" title="Jeffrey Warren 'Jeff' Daniels, American actor and playwright">Jeff Daniels</a>) orders his staff not to tell the rest of the <i>Ares III</i> crew, who are currently on their way back to Earth aboard the spacecraft <i>Hermes</i>, about <i>Watney</i> being alive.</p>
            <p><i>Watney</i> meanwhile tries to address his second biggest problem – not being able to communicate with Earth, and he suddenly realises that the site of <i>Ares III</i> is not that far from the landing site of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Pathfinder" title="Mars Pathfinder - American spacecraft that landed a base station with a roving probe on Mars in 1997">Pathfinder</a> probe. He locates the <i>Pathfinder</i> lander and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sojourner_%28rover%29" title="Sojourner - robotic Mars rover that landed on Mars aboard Mars Pathfinder spacecraft in 1997">Sojourner</a> rover, defunct since 1997, and takes them back to his compound, where he uses their equipment to regain contact with the mission control center. As the <i>Pathfinder</i> was not designed for human communication, <i>Watney</i> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory" title="Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) - a federally funded research and development centre primarily orientated on construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft">JPL</a> (former operator of the probe) devise an ingenious method of creating words and sentences by pointing the <i>Pathfinder’s</i> camera at signs arranged by <i>Watney</i> in a circle around the probe and displaying letters of the alphabet converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" title="Hexadecimal numeral system - a positional numeral system with a base of 16 (using symbols 0–9 to represent values 0-9, and symbols A-F to represent values 10-15)">hexadecimal</a> symbols. With the basic communication re-established, under instructions from mission control center <i>Watney</i> connects the probe to the <i>Ares’s</i> communication equipment and is soon able to send and receive normal text messages.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_black align_left" style="text-align: left; width: 902px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->

                Watney also starts preparations for a months-long journey to the Ares IV landing site, as reaching it is his only chance of returning back to Earth.
            </div>

            <p>As <i>Watney</i> makes good progress with his potato farming, <i>Hermes</i> flight director <i>Mitch Henderson</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bean" title="Sean Bean (born Shaun Mark Bean), English actor">Sean Bean</a>) and <i>JPL</i> director <i>Bruce Ng</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Wong" title="Benedict Wong, British actor">Benedict Wong</a>) conceive a plan to send a space probe to Mars and resupply the marooned astronaut to help him last until the <i>Ares IV</i> can reach him and take him back home. As the launch date of the resupply mission approaches, <i>Sanders</i> authorises <i>NASA</i> to tell the crew of the <i>Hermes</i> that <i>Watney</i> survived the sand storm and is still alive. With <i>NASA</i> cutting all corners in order to dispatch the probe within the small launch window available, <i>Sanders</i> makes a decision to skip inspections and the rocket carrying the probe explodes during its launch. Meantime on Mars, <i>Watney</i> suffers his own disaster when the airlock on his hab explodes, decompressing his makeshift greenhouse and killing all the crops. While he is still left with the ripe potatoes in the ground, he cannot grow any more, and his supply of food is drastically reduced.</p>
            <p>Seeing that <i>Watney’s</i> situation is serious, and <i>NASA’s</i> options after the malfunction of their resupply rocket are limited, Chinese national space agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Space_Administration" title="China National Space Administration (CNSA) - the national space agency of the People's Republic of China">CNSA</a> offers <i>NASA</i> a lifeline in the form of their classified rocket that can carry a payload to Mars. While <i>NASA</i> considers this option, <i>Rich Purnell</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Glover" title="Donald McKinley Glover, American rapper and actor">Donald Glover</a>), a <i>NASA</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics" title="Orbital mechanics a.k.a. Astrodynamics - the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of spacecraft">astrodynamicist</a>, proposes a method of rescuing <i>Watney</i> by sending the <i>Hermes</i>, resupplied by provisions delivered by the Chinese rocket, into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist" title="Gravity assist a.k.a. Gravitational Slingshot - the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft">gravitational slingshot</a> around the Earth and back to Mars. <i>Sanders</i> rejects the plan, not wanting to extend the already long <i>Ares III</i> mission, thus risking the lives of the crew, but <i>Henderson</i> sends secretly the calculations of the trajectory to the crew of the <i>Hermes</i> who vote to defy the orders from the mission control and force the latter option on <i>Sanders</i> and <i>NASA</i> by changing their trajectory according to <i>Purnell’s</i> calculations. Not having other choice, <i>NASA</i> successfully resupplies the <i>Hermes</i> using the Chinese rocket, and <i>Lewis’s</i> crew begins their second journey to Mars.</p>

                Cultivation of crops on Mars is not an easy job, as Watney finds when his makeshift greenhouse violently decompresses and all plants are destroyed by frost.
            </div>

            <p>After seven months, <i>Watney</i> has driven the modified Mars rover and all his key life support systems to the site of the planned <i>Ares IV</i> mission, just as the <i>Hermes</i> makes its second approach to Mars. But just when he thinks that he has the worst part of the plan behind him, <i>Kapoor</i> informs him that the <i>Ares IV</i> return vehicle (landed on Mars in advance of the <i>Ares IV</i> mission) is too heavy to reach the projected orbit of the <i>Hermes</i>. Following instructions from <i>Kapoor</i>, <i>Watney</i> strips the <i>Ares IV</i> capsule down to the bare minimum to save weight, including the heat shield and windows (!), using only his spacesuit to protect him from the vacuum of space, prompting him to half-joke that they are <i>‘sending him into space in a convertible’</i>. When <i>Watney's</i> vehicle despite this fails to achieve the altitude needed to be intercepted by the <i>Hermes</i>, whose speed is also too high, the crew improvises first by rupturing an airlock to release the ship’s atmosphere and slow down by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobraking" title="Aerobraking - a spaceflight manoeuvre that reduces the speed of the spacecraft by flying the vehicle through the atmosphere of a planet">aerobraking</a>, then by <i>Lewis</i> performing a tethered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity" title="Extravehicular activity (EVA) - an activity done by an astronaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth's atmosphere">EVA</a> to reach the <i>Ares IV</i> module. With the tether at its end, and several metres still between them, <i>Watney</i> pierces the glove of his pressurised space suit in order to create an improvised jet pack and, while first spinning out of control, soon comes close enough for <i>Lewis</i> being able to catch him in her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Maneuvering_Unit" title="Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) - a personal astronaut propulsion unit used by NASA">MMU</a>.</p>

            <p>Once aboard, <i>Commander Lewis</i> reports to <i>NASA</i> that all six crew members are safely aboard and the whole world, which was watching the entire rescue mission with bated breath on televisions in their homes as well as on big screens in bars, restaurants and in the city squares, erupts with excitement…</p>
