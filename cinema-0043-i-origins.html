            <p>Could it be that the eyes of an individual are the window to this person’s soul? At least that is what is suggested by the writers of the science fiction drama film <i>‘I Origins’</i> (<i>‘Eye’ Origins</i> – gedit ?).</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0043-1.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>The film was written, directed, and produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cahill_%28director%29" title="Mike Cahill, American screenwriter and film director">Mike Cahill</a> who isn’t new to the independent film production, having previously directed another low-budget science fiction drama film <i>Another Earth</i>, that was a big success at the 2011 <i>Sundance Film Festival</i> and additionally won a handful of Awards at other film festivals.</p>

            <p><i>I Origins</i> tells the story of a graduate student, <i>Ian</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pitt" title="Michael Carmen Pitt, American actor">Michael Pitt</a>), who with his colleagues <i>Kenny</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Yeun" title="Steven Yeun, Korean-American actor">Steven Yeun</a>) and <i>Karen</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Marling" title="Brit Heyworth Marling, American actress">Brit Marling</a>) researches the evolution of eyes.</p>

            <p>One day, at a Halloween party, <i>Ian</i> meets an intriguing girl, <i>Sofi</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80strid_Berg%C3%A8s-Frisbey" title="Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Franco-Spanish actress and model">Astrid Berges-Frisbey</a>), and photographs her eyes (explaining her that <i>“it’s just something I do”</i>). There is an instant chemistry between the two, but after a fleeting romance <i>Sofi</i> suddenly leaves the party without any explanation. <i>Ian</i> continues with his research, but cannot forget about <i>Sofi</i>. He has however no means of finding her again, as she left him with no telephone number or other contact information.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0043-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>Then, by a lucky coincidence, <i>Ian</i> happens upon an advertisement billboard featuring <i>Sofi's</i> unmistakable eyes, and uses it to track her down through the Internet. The two meet, start to date and before long <i>Ian</i> moves in with <i>Sofi</i>. Despite <i>Ian</i> being very rational and <i>Sofi</i> rather spiritual, their relationship quickly develops to a stage when they decide to marry. On their would-be wedding day (the registrar informs them that there is a 24-hour waiting period after the application is filed before the license can be picked up and the actual marriage can take place) <i>Karen</i> calls <i>Ian</i>, informing him that she has observed a particular species of earthworm, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenia_fetida" title="Eisenia Fetida, a species of earthworm">Eisenia Fetida</a> that, although blind, has the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAX6" title="PAX6, a key regulatory gene of eye and brain development">PAX6</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" title="Gene, the molecular unit of heredity of a living organism">gene</a> necessary for the development of eyes. This is the major breakthrough <i>Ian</i>, <i>Kenny</i> and <i>Karen</i> have been waiting for and working towards all that time.</p>

            <p><i>Ian</i> rushes to the laboratory to see <i>Karen’s</i> discovery with his own eyes and takes <i>Sofi</i> along. When <i>Sofi</i>, who is religious, finds out that <i>Ian</i> conducts his research in order to disprove creationists (by proving that eyes have evolved rather than have been created by some supreme being), she becomes upset, likening humans to these blind worms. Just because the worms cannot see light, it doesn't mean that light doesn't exist. Similarly, just because humans cannot see God, it does not follow that God doesn't exist.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0043-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>Later that day, when they are returning from <i>Ian’s</i> work back to their place, the lift they are taking breaks down and <i>Sofi</i> dies in a freak accident. <i>Ian</i> is inconsolable, but he continues with his work. Gradually, he becomes close to <i>Karen</i>, with whom he is in daily contact at their workplace, until one day when he breaks down and she is comforting him, a more intimate relationship develops between the two.</p>

            <p>Seven years later, <i>Ian</i> is a respected scientist in his field, now living with <i>Karen</i> who just gave birth to their first child. The hospital takes a routine scan of the baby’s iris, that, when entered into the database, appears to match with another person's eyes. Initially, this is dismissed as a glitch in the new computer system.</p>

            <p>A few months later, when the baby undergoes an experimental test for autism, it starts crying after seeing a photograph of a particular person. <i>Ian</i> suspects that there is more to the test than they are told and, after doing some background checks on <i>Dr. Simmons</i> who suggested the test, he finds out that the scientist is doing research in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation, religious or philosophical concept that after biological death the soul begins a new life in a new body">reincarnation</a>. Intrigued, <i>Ian</i> travels to Idaho, where he finds that the person whose eyes match their baby's had died two years earlier, just before their baby has been conceived.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0043-4.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p><i>Ian’s</i> former research partner, <i>Kenny</i>, the creator of the iris database, helps <i>Ian</i> and <i>Karen</i> run some iris photos of deceased people through the database to see if there are any matches. To their astonishment, the results indicate that <i>Sofi's</i> eyes match those of a young girl in India.</p>

            <p>Encouraged by understanding and supportive <i>Karen</i>, <i>Ian</i> travels to India to find the girl. He soon finds the facility that did the iris scans, but learns that the girl is an orphan and will be very hard to find. Almost having given up hope, in a last-ditch attempt to find the girl, <i>Ian</i> places an advert on a billboard with a photo of <i>Sofi's</i> eyes and the offer of a reward to anybody who knows the girl with the matching pair of eyes.</p>

            <p>Some time later, <i>Ian</i> finds a little girl staring at the billboard, with her eyes matching <i>Sofi's</i> down to the last detail and imperfection. He takes the girl, whose name is <i>Salomina</i>, back to his hotel room and contacts <i>Karen</i> over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" title="Skype, software for providing video chat and voice calls via the Internet">Skype</a>. With her help, <i>Ian</i> conducts a simple test on the girl, presenting her with a series of pictures depicting assorted objects and people related to <i>Sofi</i>, as well as some control images not connected to her in any way. Although <i>Salomina</i> initially picks mostly the pictures associated with <i>Sofi</i>, she becomes progressively more and more hesitant, with the final results inconclusive.</p>

            <p><i>Ian</i> feels foolish travelling all the way to India indulging in false hope. But just as he prepares to leave the hotel with the girl, she panics and starts crying when faced with taking a lift down to the lobby. <i>Ian</i> embraces crying <i>Salomina</i> and remembers <i>Sofi’s</i> words, when they once discussed their mortality: <i>“Don’t worry, we will find each other again”</i>.</p>
