                Will Scarlett Johansson’s Motoko Kusanagi live up to the original, highly coveted, cult classic anime Ghost in the Shell?
            </div>

            <p><i>Ghost in the Shell</i> is a franchise well known to any half-respected fan of anime and science fiction genre. This highly coveted cult classic consists of three original standalone anime films: <i>Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex – Solid State Society</i>) that form the <i>‘canon’</i> of the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> universe, and the franchise was recently revitalised with the latest addition that is the anime television series <a href="anime-0019-ghost-in-the-shell-arise.html" title="'Ghost in the Shell: Arise – Alternative Architecture' - a science fiction anime television series - review">Ghost in the Shell: Arise – Alternative Architecture</a>.</p>
            <p>The films, and the series, are taking place in technologically advanced Japan of the near future, and revolve around the main protagonist of the franchise <i>Major Motoko Kusanagi</i>, cybernetically augmented squad leader of <i>Public Security Section 9</i> – a fictional law-enforcement division of the Japanese government, as she goes about fighting cyber-crime, making use of her expert hacking abilities and supported by highly skilled team members of her unit: <i>Batou, Borma, Ishikawa, Paz, Saito</i> and <i>Togusa</i>.</p>
            <p><i>Ghost in the Shell</i> achieved almost legendary status amongst the fans of the franchise and has been the inspiration for many a subsequent work of science fiction, anime or otherwise.</p>
            <p>For many years now, rumours were abound that a live-action feature film based on the original anime films is in the works, but, to date, nothing came into fruition. Now finally, SCIFI<span style="color:#676767">4</span>EVER can confirm that the feature film inspired by this anime classic is in the making.</p>
            <p>The long journey started well back in 2008, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks Pictures - an American film production label of Amblin Partners">DreamWorks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Allan Spielberg, influential American film screenwriter, director and producer">Steven Spielberg</a> acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original. Several screenwriters were chosen, and subsequently dropped, to write the screenplay, until eventually it has been made known that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Herman" title="Jonathan Herman, American screenwriter">Jonathan Herman</a> was selected as a script writer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sanders" title="Rupert Miles Sanders, English film director">Rupert Sanders</a> (<i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>) is set to direct the film. Early in September 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie" title="Margot Elise Robbie, Australian actress">Margot Robbie</a> (who recently starred in <a href="cinema-0076-z-for-zachariah.html" title="Z for Zachariah - a low-budged post-apocalyptic science fiction film - review">Z for Zachariah</a> low-budged science fiction film) was in early talks to play <i>Motoko</i>, but by mid-October, the lead role was instead offered to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson" title="Scarlett Johansson, American actress">Scarlett Johansson</a>. More recently, it has also been announced that Japanese Star and television personality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kitano" title="Takeshi Kitano, Japanese comedian, television presenter, actor, screenwriter and director">Takeshi Kitano</a> will portray <i>Motoko’s</i> boss and Chief Executive Director of Public Security <i>Daisuke Aramaki</i> and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilou_Asb%C3%A6k" title="Johan Philip 'Pilou' Asbaek, Danish actor">Pilou Asbaek</a> was cast as <i>Batou, Motoko’s</i> lead team member and soul mate. Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pitt" title="Michael Carmen Pitt, American actor">Michael Pitt</a> (recently starring in the low-budget sci-fi film <a href="cinema-0043-i-origins.html" title="I Origins - a low-budget science fiction drama - review">I Origins</a>) secured the role of the film’s main villain, the sinister <i>Laughing Man</i>.</p>
            <p><i>Ghost in the Shell</i> live-action film is scheduled to start production in early 2016, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures Corporation - American film studio, television production company and motion picture distributor">Paramount Pictures</a> co-financing and co-producing it, and if everything goes well, the feature should be released in March 2017.</p>
