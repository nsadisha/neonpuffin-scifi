            <p><i>Buddy Complex (Badi Konpurekkusu)</i> is a mecha anime television series produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_%28company%29" title="Sunrise, Japanese animation studio">Sunrise</a>, directed by <i>Yasuhiro Tanabe</i>, with by the opening music score composed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuya_Kato" title="Tatsuya Kato, Japanese music composer">Tatsuya Kato</a>. The show originally aired as a 13-episode series, with 2 concluding episodes added later under the name <i>‘Buddy Complex Final Chapter: Into the Skies of Tomorrow’ Part 1 & 2</i>. A manga adaptation of the anime show ran concurrently with the television series.</p>
            <p>The series tells the story of <i>Aoba Watase</i>, an ordinary high school student coming back to school after the summer break. After the school day, <i>Aoba</i> plays basketball with his friends, watched by his classmate <i>Hina Yumihara</i> who seems to have a crush on him, when, out of the blue, a giant robot descends from the sky. <i>Aoba</i> has never seen anything like it before, but its pilot not only knows him, but clearly wants him dead.</p>
            <p><i>Aoba</i> realises that he doesn't stand a chance against the gigantic mecha suit and its pilot, but just when everything seems to be lost, <i>Hina</i> suddenly appears at the scene in her own mecha suit, confronts the attacker and, after a ferocious fight, defeats him. She then takes <i>Aoba</i> into the cockpit of her mecha suit and explains him that she, as well as his mysterious attacker, <i>Bizon</i>, came from the future.</p>

            <p>Unexpectedly, <i>Bizon</i>, who is only badly hurt, but not yet dead, attacks them again, embracing <i>Hina’s</i> mecha suit in a tight grip before initiating self destruct sequence and telling <i>Hina</i> that if he's going to die, she and <i>Aoba</i> will die along with him. Seeing that she has no way of escaping from the firm grasp of <i>Bizon’s</i> mecha suit, <i>Hina</i> shoots up towards the sky, dragging <i>Bizon</i> in his mecha suit with her. Suddenly, a time vortex appears right above them and she heads straight for it.</p>                
            <p>Inside the time vortex <i>Hina</i> tells <i>Aoba</i> these cryptic words, before disappearing: <i>“You’re going to the future now. Dio is waiting”<i>. </i>Aoba</i> barely manages to ask what is the meaning of this and who is that <i>‘Dio’</i> and then the whole world fades away.</p>

                Valiancers, huge mecha suits, are weapon of choice in the distant future, with Aoba and Dio piloting their respective Valiancers Luxon and Bradyon.
            </div>

            <p>When <i>Aoba</i> regains his consciousness, he is in the cockpit alone, and before his eyes stretches a world that he doesn’t recognise. Moreover, he emerges right in the middle of the conflict between two warring armies, both commanding a squad of gigantic mecha suits engaging each other in a fierce and merciless battle. The <i>Luxon</i> (as is his mecha suit called) self-activates and the monitor in the suit's cockpit announces <i>"Nice Coupling"</i> with <i>Dio's Bradyon</i> mecha suit.</p>
            <p>As <i>Aoba</i> later learns, the time vortex took him to year 2088. In this distant future, the <i>Free Pact Alliance</i> and the <i>Zogilia Republic</i> are at war with each other. The weapon of choice in their ongoing conflict are huge mecha suits, called <i>Valiancers</i>, similar to one Aoba pilots now. Whether by chance or predestination, <i>Aoba</i> emerges right in the middle of the battle between the two warring factions, when <i>Zogilia's Valiancer</i> squad led by <i>Bizon Gerafil</i> attacks one of the <i>Alliance's</i> secret facilities with the mission to capture the new <i>Valiancer</i> prototypes in <i>Alliance's</i> possession.</p>

                In the year 2088, Free Pact Alliance (left) and the Zogilia Republic (right) are engaged in a ruthless war.
            </div>

            <p>Being under fierce <i>Zogilia's</i> attack, <i>Captain Gengo Kuramitsu</i> on the <i>Alliance’s</i> battleship <i>Cygnus</i> recognises the seriousness of the situation and sees that he has no other choice but allow <i>‘coupling’</i> of <i>Aoba’s</i> and <i>Dio's</i> mecha suits, even though he does not recognise <i>Aoba</i> as one of <i>Alliance's Valiancer</i> pilots. <i>Aoba</i> is later explained that <i>‘coupling’</i> is a process when both involved <i>Valiancers</i> synchronise, and as a result, not only gain greatly enhanced capabilities, but their pilots also instantaneously learn each other’s combat experiences, skills and tactics.</p>
            <p>Thanks to this phenomenon, although himself a totally inexperienced pilot, <i>Aoba</i> instantly absorbs all the combat knowledge <i>Dio</i> gained during his previous combat actions, and is able to operate the <i>Valiancer</i> and engage the enemy. Together with <i>Dio Junyou Weinberg</i> (as that is <i>Dio’s</i> full name), the pair successfully defeats the <i>Zogilia’s Valiancers</i> and cause them to retreat.</p>

                Dio and Aoba are able to synchronise their Valiancers in a process called ‘coupling’ giving both pilots of the mecha suits greatly enhanced capabilities.
            </div>

            <p>The <i>Free Pact Alliance’s</i> soldiers then take <i>Aoba</i> inside the <i>Cygnus</i> battleship and interrogate him.</p>

            <p><i>Aoba</i> soon realises, that although he is really in the future, just as <i>Hina</i> told him, <i>Dio</i> does not recognise him. In order to find his place in this unfamiliar future world, <i>Aoba</i> must first earn not only <i>Free Pact Alliance’s</i> and <i>Dio’s</i> trust, but, in what will prove to be much more difficult task, also trust of <i>Hina</i> (in this timeline called <i>Hina Ryazan</i>), who not only does not recognise him, but also fights on the opposite side of this ruthless war.</p>
