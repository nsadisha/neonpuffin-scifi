The book, penned by American author of fiction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Golden" title="American author writing stories in science fiction, fantasy and horror genres">Christie Golden</a>, is The Official Movie Novelization of the likewise named science fiction adventure film directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Besson" title="Luc Besson, French film screenwriter, director, and producer">Luc Besson</a>, which itself is an adaptation of the long-running French sci-fi comic book series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val%C3%A9rian_and_Laureline" title="Valérian and Laureline - French long-running science fiction comic book series">Valérian and Laureline</a> created by the writer/artist tandem of comic strip creators <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Christin" title="Pierre Christin, French comics creator and writer">Pierre Christin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_M%C3%A9zi%C3%A8res" title="Jean-Claude Mézières, French comic strip artist and illustrator">Jean-Claude Mézières</a>.</p>
            <p>The storyline of the novel, as well as the movie of the same name, revolves around playboyish major <i>Valerian</i> and his subordinate, no-nonsense sergeant <i>Laureline</i> – a maverick team of special operatives assigned with maintaining order throughout the human extraterrestrial territories in the 28th century. This time, under the direct assignment from the Minister of Defense, the two embark on an important mission to the astounding city of <i>Alpha</i> – an enormous, ever-expanding space-based metropolis, that over the centuries evolved from the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" title="International Space Station (ISS) - a habitable artificial satellite operational in low Earth orbit since 1998">International Space Station</a> to the present-day city of <i>Alpha</i>, where hundreds of different species originating from thousands of far-away planets all over the universe have converged to live peacefully and exchange knowledge and culture with each other.</p>
            <p>But now, there is a dark mystery at the heart of <i>Alpha</i> – a sinister all-devouring force of unknown origin which threatens the very existence of the <i>City of a Thousand Planets</i>, and <i>Valerian</i> and <i>Laureline</i> must race against time to identify the source of the marauding menace before it destroys not only the city of <i>Alpha</i>, but potentially endangers the future of the entire universe and the countless species within.</p>
            
            <p><i>Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets: The Official Movie Novelization</i> by <i>Christie Golden</i> was published by <i>Titan Books</i> and is available from 4 August 2017 in paperback (288 pages) and e-book versions with RRP £7.99.</p>
