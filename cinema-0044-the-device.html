            <p class="shift_paragraph_up">Newlyweds <i>Abby</i> and <i>Calvin</i> are joined in a family cabin by <i>Abby’s</i> younger sister <i>Rebecca</i>. They met here to spread the ashes of their late mother into the lake near the cabin. The cabin brings <i>Rebecca</i> bad memories and she walks into the woods to find some solitude. <i>Abby</i> follows, as she is concerned for <i>Rebecca’s</i> safety, and together they discover a strange meadow with what seems to be some sort of crash site. They rummage through the debris and find a mysterious black ball, which <i>Abby</i>, in spite of <i>Rebecca’s</i> feeble protests, takes home, but not before noticing a small cut in her palm after lifting the ball from the ground.</p>

            <p><i>Calvin, Abby’s</i> husband, explores <i>‘the device’</i> and finds it to have strange, gravity-defying properties. He declares that (as it was recovered from a crash site) it is most likely a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder" title="Flight recorder a.k.a. 'Black box', an electronic recording device placed in an aircraft">black box</a> of a crashed plane (it’s a <i>ball</i>, stupid !) and proposes to explore it further in a hope to get a reward from whoever the plane belongs to. While handling the ball, <i>Calvin</i> gets a little cut in his palm, as got <i>Abby</i> previously. He takes the ball to the cellar for further examination.</p>

            <p>It does not take long and things start to go wrong. While <i>Abby</i> experiences strange nightmares featuring a sinister, if rather man-in-a-rubber-suit-like looking, alien being, <i>Calvin</i> starts to spend unhealthy amount of time in the cellar becoming increasingly obsessed with <i>‘the device’</i>. <i>Abby’s</i> nightmares become progressively worse, until she, suspecting that the ball has to do something with it, asks <i>Calvin</i> to dispose of it, which he reluctantly agrees to do, but secretly keeps it anyway.</p>

            <p>Abby goes to see a doctor about her nightmares and finds out that she is pregnant. However, her and <i>Calvin’s</i> joy proves to be short-lived, when <i>Calvin</i> learns (apparently the ball <i>‘tells’</i> him) that the baby <i>Abby</i> expects isn’t his. Appalled <i>Abby</i> discovers that <i>Calvin</i> lied to her and <i>‘the device’</i> is still in the house. She decides to take things into her own hands, drives the ball ashore and throws it into the sea.</p>

            <p>In the intervening time, <i>Abby</i> learns from a doctor who aborted <i>Rebecca’s</i> baby some years earlier, that <i>Rebecca</i> claimed to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction" title="Alien abduction - subjectively 'real' memories of being taken against one's will by nonhuman entities">abducted</a> and impregnated by aliens, the claim he was very sceptical about, right until he saw her grotesquely malformed baby. When <i>Calvin</i> accuses <i>Abby</i> of infidelity after the doctor informs him that he is sterile, <i>Abby</i>, to her utmost horror, realises that she too could have been inseminated by the sinister alien visitors.</p>

            <p><i>Calvin</i>, arriving home and realising that <i>‘the device’</i>, by which he is now completely controlled, is missing, takes <i>Rebecca</i> as a hostage and blackmails <i>Abby</i> to return him the ball in exchange for <i>Rebecca’s</i> life. <i>Abby</i> is desperate, as she no longer has <i>‘the device’</i>, but (wait for it) conveniently, the alien ball finds its way back home (as they do).</p>

            <p><i>Abby</i> confronts <i>Calvin</i> who is holding <i>Rebecca</i>, and, in the ensuing argument, stabs him with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penknife" title="Penknife, a small folding pocket knife">penknife</a>. Then she throws the ball into the woods with the words <i>“fetch Calvin !”</i> (OK, she actually <i>doesn’t</i> say that) and <i>Calvin</i> obeys, stumbling in the undergrowth looking for his beloved <i>‘device’</i> until he finds not only it, but also its not-so-friendly alien owner.</p>

            <p><i>The Device,</i> directed by <i>Jeremy Berg</i> (with <i>Angela DiMarco</i> playing <i>Abby</i>, <i>Kate Alden</i> her sister <i>Rebecca</i> and <i>David S. Hogan</i> her husband <i>Calvin</i>), does not work as a sci-fi film, horror or thriller. What I am saying – it doesn’t work as a film – full stop. With the unconvincing plot matched only by equally unconvincing performances of the actors and truly awful <i>‘special’</i> effects, there is really nothing positive to be said about this disaster of a movie. If I say that the best thing about the film is its rather clever-looking theatrical poster, (that, incidentally, is completely deceiving, as it has no relevance to the storyline whatsoever) you probably get the picture.</p>
