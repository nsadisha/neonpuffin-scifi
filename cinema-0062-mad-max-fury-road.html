            <p>It was a lengthy, 30-year-long wait, since the last <i>Mad Max</i> film titled <i>‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’</i> was released, but it was a wait worth waiting. <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, the latest instalment in the <i>‘Mad Max’</i> franchise, was released to raving reviews, cementing the series’ standing in the post-apocalyptic science fiction genre.</p>

                Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to the Mad Max universe as the main baddie, this time not as (now dead) Toecutter, but as Immortan Joe – leader of the ‘War Boys’ gang.

            <p>The road to the latest film of the series, similarly to <i>Mad Max’s</i> journey through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, was a perilous and long one. Already back in 2003, creator of the franchise and director of the first three <i>Mad Max</i> films, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Miller_%28director%29" title="George Miller, Australian film director, screenwriter and producer">George Miller</a>, announced that a script had been written for a fourth film, and that pre-production was in the early stages. Fans of the franchise rejoiced at the news, but despite the project being green-lit with a $100 million budget, the film didn’t materialise. The production was hit by various complications and delays, and it took an additional 12 years before the movie hit the box office. And perhaps it was for the better, because these twelve years gave the filmmakers ample time to get everything ‘just right’ and perfect the final product. And perfect it they did. The film was universally acclaimed by critics (including <i>scifi4ever</i>) and praised for its screenplay, acting, choreography, stunts, practical effects (the majority of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects: stunts, make-up and sets, with CGI used sparingly, mainly to enhance the landscape, remove stunt rigging, and ‘amputate’ <i>Charlize Theron’s</i> lower left arm) and, last but not least, for its peculiar and wicked humour.</p>

            <p><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> takes place in the midst of post-apocalyptic Australia (with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib_Desert" title="Namib Desert, coastal desert stretching along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia and South Africa">Namib Desert</a> standing in for Australia’s wasteland), years after the <i>‘Mad’ Max Rockatansky</i> lost his family to <i>Toecutter’s</i> motorcycle gang. The world is only slowly recovering from the aftermath of nuclear war. Civilization has collapsed and radioactive fallout causes sickness and birth defects amongst the dwindling rag-tag populace.</p>
            <p>In the first scene of the film, <i>Max Rockatansky</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hardy" title="Edward Thomas 'Tom' Hardy, English actor">Tom Hardy</a>) is ambushed in the desert, his <i>Interceptor</i> car is destroyed and he is captured by the <i>‘War Boys’</i> – the makeshift army of their tyrannical leader <i>Immortan Joe</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Keays-Byrne" title="Hugh Keays-Byrne, British India-born, Australian television and film actor">Hugh Keays-Byrne</a>). He is taken to <i>Citadel</i> – a natural fortress of rock with ample supplies of water and greenery that <i>Joe</i> keeps only for himself and a privileged few. As a universal blood donor, <i>Max</i> is bound and used as a ‘blood bag’ for the sickly <i>Nux</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Hoult" title="Nicholas Caradoc Hoult, English actor">Nicholas Hoult</a>).</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, <i>Imperator Furiosa</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlize_Theron" title="Charlize Theron, South African-American actress and fashion model">Charlize Theron</a>) aboard her heavily-armoured <i>War Rig</i>, embarks on a mission to get some fuel for the ever-hungry engines of <i>Immortan Joe’s</i> vehicle fleet. Unbeknown to <i>Joe</i>, <i>Furiosa’s</i> fuel run is only a ruse she carefully devised. The true goal of her expedition is to escape from <i>Citadel</i> and reach the <i>‘Green Place’</i>, community where she was born and was abducted from as a child. <i>Furiosa</i> doesn’t run alone though. She is escaping along with five wives of <i>Immortan Joe</i> (complete with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastity_belt" title="Chastity belt, lockable, wearable braces designed to prevent sexual intercourse">chastity belts</a>), whom she rescued from <i>Joe’s</i> harem.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:-20px;">It doesn’t take long and <i>Joe</i> sees that something is amiss. Realising that he was duped, furious <i>Joe</i> and his <i>War Boy</i> army mount their assorted, heavily-modified and armed vehicles and set out in pursuit of the escapees. This triggers an epic chase through the deserts of post-apocalyptic world, lasting for most of the movie. <i>Max</i>, who is initially chained to the front of <i>Nux’s</i> war car, escapes and, with a little help from <i>Nux</i>, who eventually turns sides, reluctantly assists <i>Furiosa</i> in her quest to free the <i>Immortan Joe’s</i> breeding princess-brides from the <i>War Boys’</i> despotic leader, and helps her to find her former home, the <i>‘Green Place’</i> (which turns out to look a bit different than she remembered it).</p>

                Nicholas Hoult and Charlize Theron excel as, respectively, Nux and Imperator Furiosa. Three of the Immortan Joe’s harem escapees can be seen in the background.

            <p>In an earlier interview, <i>George Miller</i> said that he wanted the film to be almost a <br/>continuous chase, with relatively little dialogue, and to have the visuals come before words. Paraphrasing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, former English-born, Hollywood-based film director and producer">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, <i>Miller</i> said that he wanted the film to be understood even in Japan without the need to read subtitles.</p>
            <p>And while other movies with long action sequences run out of puff after a few minutes, or conversely, carry on seemingly forever but soon become dreary and implausible, <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> somehow manages to keep you gripped and on your toes all the way through. An absolute must for fans of post-apocalyptic science fiction and action movies alike.</p>

            <p><i>George Miller</i> earlier revealed that he found during the writing process for <i>‘Fury Road’</i> that there is more than enough story material for two additional scripts. He also said in the interview in <i>Wired</i> magazine: <i>“Should [Mad Max: Fury Road] be successful, I’ve got two other stories to tell.”</i>, and later revealed that there are plans for the sequel titled <i>‘Mad Max: The Wasteland’</i> with <i>Tom Hardy</i> reprising the role of <i>‘Mad’ Max Rockatansky</i>.</p>
