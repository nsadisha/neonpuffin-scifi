            <p><i>Chappie</i> is a science fiction comedy film directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neill_Blomkamp" title="Neill Blomkamp, South African–Canadian film and advertisement screenwriter and director">Neill Blomkamp</a> who co-wrote the screenplay with his spouse <i>Terri Tatchell</i>, a Canadian screenwriter. The movie is based on <i>Blomkamp’s</i> short film <i>Tetra Vaal</i>, and similarly to his first sci-fi film <i>District 9</i>, the film was shot, and the storyline is set, in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>

            <p>The South Africa born, Canada based film director has been peddling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner" title="Afrikaners, a South African white ethnic group descended from Dutch settlers">Afrikaner</a> wares since his first film, and <i>Chappie</i>, which not only casts his long-time friend, South African actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharlto_Copley" title="Sharlto Copley, South African actor">Sharlto Copley</a> in the main role (voice and motion capture), but also features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watkin_Tudor_Jones" title="Watkin Tudor Jones a.k.a. 'Ninja', a South African rapper co-fronting the rap-rave group 'Die Antwoord'">Watkin Tudor Jones</a> (a.k.a. <i>Ninja</i>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolandi_Visser" title="Anri du Toit, a.k.a. 'Yo-Landi Vi$$er', a South African rapper and a vocalist in the rap-rave group 'Die Antwoord'">Anri du Toit</a> (a.k.a. <i>Yo-Landi Visser</i>) of the South African alternative hip-hop group <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Antwoord" title="Die Antwoord (Afrikaans for 'The Answer'), a South African rap-rave group formed in Cape Town in 2008">Die Antwoord</a>, is not an exception.</p>

            <p>In the near future, South African police struggles to cope with a rash of gun violence and a spiralling crime rate in Johannesburg. The long overdue respite comes in the form of highly efficient, semi-autonomous robotic law-enforcement units from the weapons manufacturer <i>Tetravaal</i>. The robots, known as <i>Scouts</i>, prove to be an instant success, and the crime rate falls to a record low.</p>

            <p>At the company’s Johannesburg plant, the <i>Scout</i> designer, <i>Deon Wilson</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_Patel" title="Dev Patel, British actor">Dev Patel</a>) attracts the envy of fellow robotics engineer <i>Vincent Moore</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman" title="Hugh Jackman, Australian actor">Hugh Jackman</a>), whose own design, the remotely-operated battle platform <i>‘MOOSE’</i>, is derided by the <i>Tetravaal’s</i> customers, who consider <i>Moore’s</i> creation far too clunky and an overkill for their public law-enforcement needs.</p>

            <p><i>Deon</i> is not content with his creations and, in his free time at home, secretly develops software that exhibits true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence (AI), human-like intelligence exhibited by machines or software">artificial intelligence</a>. When he wants to test the AI on one of the decommissioned <i>Scouts</i>, <i>Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver" title="Sigourney Weaver, American actress">Sigourney Weaver</a>), who sees this as an unwelcome distraction from the ‘serious’ business matters, denies his request. Undeterred, <i>Deon</i> steals the damaged robot and loads it into his van, along with some spare parts required for its repair and the <i>‘guard key’</i> necessary to update the robot’s operating system.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0053-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12px;" />

            <p>In the meanwhile, a small gang consisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watkin_Tudor_Jones" title="Watkin Tudor Jones a.k.a. 'Ninja', a South African rapper co-fronting the rap-rave group 'Die Antwoord'">Ninja</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolandi_Visser" title="Anri du Toit, a.k.a. 'Yo-Landi Vi$$er', a South African rapper and a vocalist in the rap-rave group 'Die Antwoord'">Yolandi</a> and <i>Yankie</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Pablo_Cantillo" title="Jose Pablo Cantillo, American Latino actor">Jose Pablo Cantillo</a>) displeases the local gangster boss <i>Hippo</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Auret" title="Brandon Auret, South African actor">Brandon Auret</a>), who gives them 7 days to pay a debt of 20 million rand. The three are at their wits’ end how to get such a huge amount of money at such a short notice, when <i>Yolandi</i> comes up with an ‘ingenious’ idea: <i>Scouts</i> are just electronic devices, like television sets, she argues, so surely there must be some kind of ‘remote’ that could turn them off, allowing the gang to pull off a huge heist unhindered by the police robots. The rest of the gang likes the plan and decides to kidnap one of <i>Tetravaal’s</i> engineers. By an unlucky coincidence, this engineer happens to be <i>Deon</i>, who is ambushed by the trio on his way home.</p>

            <p>After the gangsters take <i>Deon</i> to their hideout in an old factory, they are disappointed to learn that there isn’t such a remote control or, indeed, any other way to turn off the <i>Scouts</i>. Finding the broken robot in the van, they instead force <i>Deon</i> to re-program the damaged <i>Scout</i> to fight for them. <i>Deon</i>, after threatened with death, agrees and installs the AI software into the <i>Scout</i>, but explains that the re-programmed robot will exhibit child-like behaviour and will need to learn everything, including language, from scratch. This doesn’t suit the gangsters, as they are under time pressure, but they have no other choice. <i>Deon</i> is forced to leave, but not before compelling the AI-enhanced <i>Scout</i> to make a promise to never kill a human, and <i>‘Chappie’</i>, as <i>Yolandi</i> names the robot, stays with the gangsters.</p>

            <p><i>Yolandi’s</i> maternal instincts kick in and she tries to protect <i>Chappie</i>, but <i>Ninja</i> grows impatient with his slow development, due to both the impending deadline from <i>Hippo</i> and <i>Chappie’s</i> irreplaceable battery running out, giving him only days to live. <i>Ninja</i> tries to toughen-up child-like <i>Chappie</i> by leaving him to fend for himself in a rough neighbourhood, where he is first attacked by a group of youths and later captured by <i>Vincent</i>, who has found out about <i>Chappie</i> after following <i>Deon</i> to the gangsters’ hideout.</p>

            <p><i>Vincent</i> successfully extracts the <i>‘guard key’</i> from <i>Chappie’s</i> chassis for his own, nefarious use, but when he wants to cut the, now superfluous, robot to pieces by a power saw, terrified <i>Chappie</i> manages to jump out of the van and ultimately find his way to the only place he knows as his ‘home’ – the gangsters’ hideout.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0053-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12px;" />

            <p>After <i>Chappie</i> refuses to handle firearms (remembering the solemn vow he had made to <i>Deon</i>), <i>Ninja</i> and <i>Yankie</i> trick the robot to turn to crime by training him in martial arts and bladed weapons handling, lying to him about needing the money from the robberies to replace his faulty body for a new one with a full battery.</p>

            <p>During the course of the next few days, <i>Chappie</i> goes through a steep learning curve, with <i>Ninja</i> and <i>Yolandi</i> becoming his adoptive ‘parents’, learning about life the hard way and, just like his ‘mommy’ and ‘daddy’, becoming a street-smart, slum-hardened, bad-ass gangsta, stealing and robbing for his ‘parents’, while never forgetting the promise he had made to <i>Deon</i>.</p>

            <p><i>Chappie’s</i> newly learned martial skills come very useful in the final showdown between his gangsta ‘family’ and the <i>MOOSE</i>, after <i>Vincent</i> uses the stolen <i>‘guard key’</i> to upload a virus into all <i>Scouts</i>, rendering them useless and sparking massive riots across the city, in order to prove the worth of his uber-sized battle droid, which he unleashes on the gangsters.</p>

            <p>At the end, <i>Chappie</i> finally warms up to <i>Deon</i>, after initially rejecting him (because <i>Ninja</i> lied to him that <i>Deon</i> built him purposely with a near-empty battery, condemning him to an early death), and when his battery eventually runs out and he faces a difficult choice to preserve his own life, or save the life of his ‘maker’ he opts to save <i>Deon</i>.</p>

            <p>As far as the production goes, this movie is a lot better than some critics would have had you believe. Sure, there are some narrative shortcomings, but these can be easily overlooked as this flick is really fun to watch. The film is not only jam-packed with well-timed gags, making it in parts laugh-out-loud funny, but is also moving and thought-provoking in places. All in all, <i>Chappie</i> is yet another solid entry to the science fiction genre by film director <i>Neill Blomkamp</i>.</p>
