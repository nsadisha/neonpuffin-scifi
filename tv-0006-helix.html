                A team of scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrive at Arctic Biosystems research facility to investigate an outbreak of unknown disease.
            </div>

            <p><i>Helix</i> is an American science fiction drama television series produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Television" title="Sony Pictures Television, American television production and distribution studio">Sony Pictures Television</a> that premiered on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy" title="Syfy, American cable and satellite television channel">Syfy</a> in January 2014. The series follows a small team of scientists from the <i>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the leading national public health institute of the United States">CDC</a>) who arrive at a research facility in the Arctic to investigate an outbreak of unknown, highly infectious disease. Soon after their arrival however, they realise that they are dealing with something far more sinister and far-reaching, with the potential implications for the future of the whole mankind. One of the executive producers of <i>Helix</i> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_D._Moore" title="Ronald Dowl Moore, American screenwriter and television producer">Ronald D. Moore</a> of the re-imagined <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> fame.</p>
            <p>A distinctive feature of the series is that each episode represents the events of one day within the story, thus the entire thirteen episodes of the first season take place in under two weeks of <i>Helix</i>-universe time.</p>

                <b>Dr. Alan Farragut</b>, the leader of the team, is former husband of Julia Walker and is romantically involved with Sarah Jordan, another member of the team.
            </div>

            <p>A four-member team of epidemiologists from the <i>CDC</i>, led by <i>Dr. Alan Farragut</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Campbell" title="William Oliver 'Billy' Campbell, American film and television actor">Billy Campbell</a>), and comprising scientists <i>Dr. Julia Walker</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyra_Zagorsky" title="Kyra Zagorsky, American film and television actress">Kyra Zagorsky</a>), <i>Dr. Sarah Jordan</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hayes_%28actress%29" title="Jordan Hayes, Canadian actress">Jordan Hayes</a>) and <i>Dr. Doreen Boyle</i> (<i>Catherine Lemieux</i>) are tasked with investigating a strange viral outbreak at <i>Arctic Biosystems</i>, a remote bioresearch installation in the Arctic. Upon their arrival, they are met with the head of the research facility <i>Dr. Hiroshi Hatake</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Sanada" title="Hiroyuki Sanada, Japanese film, television and stage actor">Hiroyuki Sanada</a>) who, despite trying to appear friendly and forthcoming, seems to be hiding something. They soon find that there is more than meets the eye, with some areas of the station completely off-limits to the members of the team, and with the <i>Ilaria Corporation</i>, the company running the research station, clearly more interested in containing the knowledge about the true nature and goals of their experiments at the facility, than in resolving the outbreak.</p>
            <p>It soon becomes apparent that the scientists at the facility were developing some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent" title="Biological weapon, a bacterium or virus that can be used as a weapon in biological warfare">bioweapon</a> and that they have succeeded in creating two variants of a highly pathogenic and contagious virus: <i>NARVIK-A</i> with a close to 100% mortality rate, and <i>NARVIK-B</i> with a nearly 100% infection rate but 0% mortality rate. Those infected with <i>NARVIK-B</i> have their consciousness overtaken by primal instincts and turn into extremely agile, overly violent, zombie-like creatures dubbed by the scientists <i>‘Vectors’</i>. The <i>Vectors</i> are driven by an insatiable urge to infect other victims by the interchange of highly contagious black bodily fluids, primarily through mouth-to-mouth contact. Collective behaviour of the <i>Vectors</i> is not unlike that of a pack of animals, in that there is a dominant member that exerts control over the whole group.</p>

               <b>Dr. Julia Walker</b> believes that she spent her childhood in a cabin in Montana, and is shocked when she learns from her father Hatake that she actually grew up in the mock-up of their family house built in the basement of the Arctic Biosystems facility.
            </div>

            <p>One of the infected is <i>Dr. Peter Farragut</i> (<i>Neil Napier</i>), researcher at the facility and <i>Dr. Alan Farragut’s</i> brother. <i>Alan</i> tries to cure <i>Peter</i> using all sorts of radical, untested treatments, with <i>Peter</i> temporarily regaining some normality, before relapsing, escaping from quarantine, infecting <i>Julia</i> and joining the rest of the <i>Vectors</i> as their, rather imposing, leader.</p>
            <p>The <i>CDC</i> team tries to find a cure for the infected patients and contain the outbreak by isolating those exposed to the virus, but attempts at quarantine result in mutiny and foiled escape of the infected, and all hopes of reinforcements are dashed when the communication with the outside world is cut off after saboteur’s explosive charge destroys the satellite dish.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile, <i>Doreen</i> is murdered by one of the <i>Ilaria’s</i> mercenaries, <i>Major Sergio Balleseros</i> (<i>Mark Ghanime</i>) after she gets too close to figuring out what is really happening at the facility.</p>

                <b>Dr. Sarah Jordan</b> is suffering from severe hand tremors caused by the effects of a cancerous spinal tumour that she is secretly battling. 
            </div>

            <p>After becoming infected, <i>Julia</i> is taken care of and cured by <i>Hatake</i>, who reveals that he is her father. It also transpires that he is over 500 years old and one of the <i>‘Immortals’</i> - an elite group of people who benefit, or in some instances suffer, from the eternal life. <i>Immortals</i> also heal more quickly than <i>‘normal’</i> humans and can be easily recognised by their eerily silver eyes that they often hide behind natural-colour contact lenses. The <i>Immortals</i>, who run the <i>Ilaria Corporation</i>, had created the <i>NARVIK</i> virus in order to establish control over the world, as <i>Vectors</i> have a unique ability of detecting whether a particular person is already infected, or is one of the <i>Immortals</i>, and if it is the latter, they instantly become passive and subservient in behaviour, which gives the <i>Immortals</i> a form of immunity from the infected.</p>
            <p>To regain control of the situation, <i>Ilaria </i>despatches its executive <i>Constance Sutton</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeri_Ryan" title="Jeri Lynn Ryan, American actress">Jeri Ryan</a>), who arrives at the research station with a small army of mercenaries and begins pressuring the members of the <i>CDC</i> team into creating, and handing over, an anti-viral cure to benefit the <i>Ilaria Corporation's</i> objectives. <i>Sutton</i> informs <i>Hatake</i> that he has lost the confidence of her superiors and tries to relieve him of his position by taking charge of the installation. However, <i>Hatake</i> soon retakes control by killing <i>Sutton</i> with a garrotte.</p>

                <b>Dr. Doreen Boyle</b> pays with her life for getting too close to figuring out what is really happening at the bio-research facility. 
            </div>

            <p>The <i>CDC</i> scientists, under constant attacks of the <i>Vectors</i>, at last succeed in creating the cure for the disease, and <i>Sarah’s</i> terminal cancer is miraculously cured by an injection of <i>Julia’s</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid" title="Cerebrospinal fluid, a clear colourless bodily fluid found in the brain and spine">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, though as a side-effect, she too becomes one of the <i>Immortals</i>. The <i>CDC</i> team, now in possession of the cure, ambushes the remaining <i>Vectors</i>, including <i>Peter</i>, and injects them with the antiviral serum.</p>
            <p>After losing <i>Sutton</i>, the board of <i>Ilaria</i> sends in <i>‘The Scythe’</i> (called so, rather confusingly, for his preference for a pair of <i>sickles</i> as the weapon of choice), merciless psychotic assassin with the outward appearance of a 16-year-old boy, who is revealed to be the <i>Immortal Spencer Chiswick</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Naylor_%28actor%29" title="Robert Naylor, Canadian actor">Robert Naylor</a>), <i>Constance Sutton’s</i> son. <i>The Scythe</i> comes with a strict order: get the virus and take <i>Hatake</i>, alive; kill everyone else – and he is happy to oblige, killing the bulk of the remaining survivors, just as they recovered from the effects of the infection.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, <i>Alan</i> and <i>Peter</i> (who makes a full recovery) learn that an unknown viral infection has hit Puerto Rico and deduce it to be <i>NARVIK A</i> – the more deadly version of the virus. <i>Alan</i> is sure it’s <i>Ilaria</i> who is conducting a test of the virus, but he is confident they can contain it, now when they have the cure.</p>

            <p><i>Spencer</i> is briefly captured, but then set free by <i>Peter</i>, who is revealed to be working for <i>Ilaria</i> all along. <i>The Scythe</i> blows up the installation (by triggering the explosive charges set around the building by <i>Hatake</i> in anticipation of the arrival of <i>Ilaria’s</i> mercenaries) stealing <i>both</i> the virus <i>and</i> the cure. He also takes <i>Julia</i> hostage and is about to flee in an <i>Ilaria’s</i> helicopter, when <i>Alan </i>jumps aboard and tries to free <i>Julia</i>, but only succeeds in snatching one of the canisters, containing <i>either</i> the virus <i>or</i> the cure, before <i>Spencer</i> pushes him off the rising chopper.</p>

            <p>While the plot of <i>Helix</i> may not be the most original ever written, and the science of the show is not entirely up to scratch, the series offers enough twists and turns, as well as thrills and suspense, to keep you coming for more. Definitely a better take on the <i>“viral pandemic threatens to wipe out the human race”</i> scenario than <a href="tv-0003-the-last-ship.html" title="Science fiction television series 'The Last Ship'">The Last Ship</a>.</p>
            <p><i>Helix</i> was renewed for a 13-episode second season, returning in January 2015.</p>
