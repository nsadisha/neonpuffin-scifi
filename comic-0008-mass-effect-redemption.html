            <p>or fans of video games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect" title="Mass Effect - a line of science fiction role-playing video games developed by the Canadian company BioWare">Mass Effect</a> is a title which does not need an introduction. Since its conception in 2007, the franchise has grown right across the media and apart from the original trilogy of video games (<i>Mass Effect 1-3</i>), now includes the upcoming fourth video game <i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i>, four novels, several comic book series, a board game, two sets of action figures, one anime film and a possible feature film in the making.</p>

            <p>Each of the instalments, regardless of the media used, fits firmly at a particular place in the complex chronology of the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe.</p>
            <p><i>Mass Effect: Redemption</i> is a four-issue comic book mini-series, events of which take place at some time after the events of the first video game and just before the events of the <i>Mass Effect 2</i>.</p>           
            <p>Written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jackson_Miller" title="John Jackson Miller, American science-fiction author and comic book writer, known for his work on the Star Wars franchise">John Jackson Miller</a> with art by <i>Omar Francia</i>, both experienced industry veterans who have previously worked, amongst other projects, on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_universe" title="Star Wars Expanded Universe - encompasses all officially licensed Star Wars material, including television series, books, comic books, video games, toys and other assorted media">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> comics, its story revolves around <i>Dr. Liara T'Soni</i>, an <i>Asari</i> scientist. At 106 years old, barely an adult by <i>Asari</i> norms, <i>Liara</i> is an expert in the field of <i>Prothean</i> archaeology and has a passion for studying <i>Prothean</i> technology.</p>
            <p>Shortly after helping to win the legendary <i>Battle of the Citadel</i>, commander <i>Shepard</i>, hero of the galaxy, disappears in a mysterious attack on his spaceship <i>Normandy</i>. <i>Shepard’s</i> friends, including <i>Liara T'Soni</i>, want answers. But they are not only ones who are searching for <i>Shepard</i>. The investigation takes <i>Liara</i> to <i>Afterlife Club</i> on the space station <i>Omega</i>, where she hires a <i>Drell</i>, known as <i>Feron</i>, to help her find her lost friend. <i>Feron</i> informs <i>Liara</i> that <i>Shepard</i> is dead and that there is an unnatural interest in his remains. <i>Liara</i> later meets the <i>Illusive Man</i>, figurehead of <i>Cerberus</i>, a secretive organization representing the interests of humanity, who wants <i>Shepard’s</i> body back in human hands.</p>

            <p>The <i>Collectors</i>, an enigmatic alien race, have hired the <i>Shadow Broker</i>, who in turn hired the <i>Blue Sun</i> mercenaries, to retrieve <i>Shepard's</i> body as well. <i>Liara</i> locates <i>Blue Suns</i> with their peculiar cargo and prepares an ambush, but <i>Feron</i>, who is a double agent working for <i>Shadow Broker</i>, blows their hideout just as she wants to strike and seize <i>Shepard’s</i> body. In the ensuing scuffle, both <i>Liara</i> and <i>Blue Suns</i> fail in their plans, but <i>Shadow Broker has</i> a contingency plan - he sends in <i>Tazzik</i>, a highly skilled <i>Salarian</i> hit-man, who manages to get hold of the body. <i>Liara</i> and <i>Feron</i> are in hot pursuit of the abductor’s spaceship and they manage to catch up with <i>Tazzik</i> just as he is handing over the <i>Shepard's</i> body to <i>Collectors</i>. When everything seems to be lost, <i>Feron</i>, who turns out to be not a double, but triple agent (working neither for <i>Liara</i> nor for <i>Shadow Broker</i>, but in fact for <i>Cerberus</i>), instigates confusion in which <i>Liara</i> manages to fly away with the <i>Shepard's</i> body in <i>Tazzik’s</i> spaceship, but is forced to leave <i>Feron</i> behind and let him face the full wrath of furious <i>Tazzik</i>.</p>

            <p><i>Miller</i> and <i>Francia</i> know their trade and their co-operation with <i>Mass Effect 2</i> lead writer <i>Mac Walters</i> had undoubtedly a highly positive effect on the development of this comic book. The plot is solid and to the point, the dialogues are witty, the art is of a very high standard and the main characters are instantly recognisable. <i>Mass Effect: Redemption</i> is an essential reading for all fans of the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe.</p>
