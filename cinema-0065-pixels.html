            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" title="Space Invaders - an arcade video game, one of the earliest shooters, developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released by Taito in 1978">Space Invaders</a> was the first proper video game (not counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" title="Pong - one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports video game (based on table tennis)">Pong</a>) I ever played. The amusement arcade where I encountered this, by nowadays standards very primitive, game for the first time was only a temporary – carnival trailer-based one, and I had only a few days to hone my skills on the game, before the attraction moved to another town, but by that time I was already completely hooked, and knew precisely what I wanted: to have my very own game console, so that I can play games at home, at my leisure, anytime, as long as I want, and most importantly, without the need to constantly feed the little bugger with coins. In the following years I bought my first gaming computer – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum" title="ZX Spectrum - an 8-bit personal home computer, used mainly for gaming, released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd">ZX Spectrum</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500" title="Amiga 500 - a 16-bit multimedia personal home computer, used mainly for gaming, released by Commodore in 1987">Amiga</a>, and finally moved on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer" title="Gaming PC - a personal computer, enhanced by adding performance-oriented components such as a high-end CPU and video card, designed for playing computationally demanding video games">PC</a> gaming.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0065-1.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />
                        
            <p>The first arcade video games had very low resolution, (hence the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel" title="Pixel - a physical point in a raster image, or the smallest addressable element in a display device">Pixels</a>’ in the title of the film), only basic graphics and provided mediocre entertainment with a little replay value. Unfortunately, the latter can also be said about the titular science fiction comedy film produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., American film production and distribution studio (a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment)">Columbia Pictures</a>, which is inspired by these games.</p>
            <p>The story of the <i>Pixels</i> starts in 1982, when <i>Sam Brenner</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sandler" title="Adam Richard Sandler, American actor, screenwriter, producer, comedian and musician">Adam Sandler</a>) and <i>Will Cooper</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_James" title="Kevin George Knipfing, a.k.a. Kevin James, American actor, screenwriter and producer">Kevin James</a>) are thirteen-year-old friends that love playing video games at the local arcade. <i>Brenner</i>, who is the better gamer of the two, enters an arcade game world championship, where he finishes second to his nemesis, pompous <i>Eddie ‘Fireblaster’ Plant</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage" title="Peter Hayden Dinklage, American actor best known for portraying Tyrion Lannister in the HBO series Game of Thrones">Peter Dinklage</a>) (whose character was apparently modelled on real-life <i>Pac-Man</i> and <i>Donkey Kong</i> world champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mitchell_%28video_game_player%29" title="Billy L. Mitchell, American video game player best known for recording high scores in classic arcade games">Billy Mitchell</a>). The two later meet and befriend another video-games-obsessed youth <i>Ludlow Lamonsoff</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gad" title="Joshua Ilan 'Josh' Gad, American film and television actor">Josh Gad</a>), a much younger, socially-inept, conspiracy-theories-obsessed kid. As promised by the organisers of the event, the footage from the championship is included in a time capsule that NASA launches into space aboard one of their rockets.</p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_cinema/cinema0065-3.png" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>Fast-forward to the present day, <i>Cooper</i> is now the president of the United States, while <i>Brenner</i> is working for <i>‘NERD’</i> – a company that sets up audio-video equipment for the less technically-minded. Brenner goes to the house of <i>Violet van Patten</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Monaghan" title="Michelle Lynn Monaghan, American actress">Michelle Monaghan</a>) to install a gaming console and television set for her young son, who has received these as a gift to distract him from his parents’ impending divorce. Unknown to <i>Brenner</i>, who immediately falls for <i>Violet</i>, <i>van Patten</i> is a special weapons expert for the military in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile, aliens have found the aforementioned time capsule from the 80s, but, having misunderstood the included footage from the video games tournament, assumed this being a declaration of war. Now, having created giant versions of assorted characters from several well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrogaming" title="Retrogaming a.k.a. classic gaming - playing or collecting of old personal computer, console and arcade video games">retro video games</a>, including <i>Asteroids, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Arkanoid</i> and <i>Tetris</i>, aliens challenge humans to a world-spanning video game contest, and threaten to claim planet Earth as the prize, should they win three rounds.</p>    

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0065-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />
                               
            <p>The first two attacks are aimed at the U.S. military base in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam" title="Guam - an organized, unincorporated territory of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean">Guam</a>, where the aliens use oversized characters from video game <i>Galaga</i>, and against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal" title="Taj Mahal - a white marble mausoleum located on the southern bank of Yamuna River in the Indian city of Agra built in the 17th century">Taj Mahal</a> in India, which is destroyed by gigantic <i>Arkanoid</i> paddles. This being a comedy, the victims of the attacks don’t get killed, but are – well – pixelated! With the third attack looming, the president summons <i>Brenner</i> and <i>Ludlow</i> to help with the defence. During the next offensive in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London" title="Hyde Park, one of the largest Royal Parks in London, famous for its Speakers' Corner">Hyde Park</a>, London, the aliens use for the attack giant characters from the video game <i>Centipede</i>. After the military fails to deflect the attack, <i>Brenner</i> and <i>Ludlow</i> step in, take over, and win the <i>‘game’</i>, shooting down the centipedes using the light-beam guns developed by <i>Lieutenant Colonel Violet van Patten</i>.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0065-4.png" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>To help them to face the next attack, taking place in the streets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City - the most populous city in the United States and the center of the New York metropolitan area">New York City</a> and using enormous <i>Pac-Man</i> characters, <i>Brenner</i> and <i>Ludlow</i> enlist the help of <i>Plant</i> (released from prison, where he is doing time for fraud, with the promise of a pardon, if he helps to avert the alien invasion). For this challenge, the trio is presented with four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Hatch" title="Mini Cooper S a.k.a. Mini Hatch - a three-door hatchback, based on the iconic 60's 'Mini' car, produced by BMW">Mini Coopers</a> in place of the <i>ghosts</i> that chase <i>Pac-Man</i> in the game, with the fourth car driven by the game's creator <i>Toru Iwatani</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Akiyama" title="Denis Akiyama, Japanese-Canadian actor and voice actor">Denis Akiyama</a>). The <i>‘Team Earth’</i> wins again and, in the aftermath of the game, hold a ball to celebrate the victory.</p>
            <p>However, their celebrations are cut short when the aliens send a message saying that someone cheated during the last game, and the contest for the planet has been therefore forfeited. It turns out that <i>Eddie ‘the Fireblaster’ Plant</i> is a life-long fraud, cheating not only in the last game, but also during the 1980’s arcade games tournament (in both cases using cheat codes etched into his sunglasses) to become the world champion. The aliens announce that they are no longer bound by the protocol and send in all the arcade game characters for the final decisive attack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C. - the capital of the United States of America">Washington, D.C.</a>, with the aim to take over the Earth.</p>

            <p>In the last desperate attempt to save the Earth from the alien invaders, <i>Brenner, Cooper</i> and <i>Violet van Patten</i> board the alien mothership. Inside the spacecraft, the aliens have constructed a huge three-dimensional obstacle course based on a <i>Donkey Kong</i> level. <i>Brenner</i> now faces his biggest challenge: to not only beat the aliens and save humankind, but also get better of <i>Eddie Plant</i> and reclaim his well-deserved title of the best arcade video game player in the world…</p>
