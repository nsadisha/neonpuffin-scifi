            <p><i>Interstellar</i>, an epic science fiction film directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" title="English-American film screenwriter, director and producer Christopher Jonathan James Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>, tells the story of a small team of astronauts led by a former <i>NASA</i> test pilot <i>Cooper</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey" title="American actor Matthew David McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>), who, after the Earth became nigh-on uninhabitable, joins biologist <i>Amelia</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway" title="American actress Anne Jacqueline Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>), geographer <i>Doyle</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Bentley" title="American actor Wesley Cook 'Wes' Bentley">Wes Bentley</a>), physicist <i>Romilly</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gyasi" title="David Kwaku Asamoah Gyasi, English actor of Ghanaian origin">David Gyasi</a>) and two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</a> robots, <i>CASE</i> and <i>TARS</i> aboard an experimental spacecraft <i>Endurance</i> on a daring expedition to a distant galaxy in search of a new habitable planet for the ailing humanity.</p>

            <p>While the view that the other stars are similar to the Sun, and are likewise accompanied by planets, was put forward already in the 16th century by the Italian philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno" title="Giordano Bruno, Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician and astrologer">Giordano Bruno</a>, until the early 1990s the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet" title="Exoplanet a.k.a. extrasolar planet">exoplanets</a> was merely speculative, as there was no known method of detecting them. The first confirmed discovery of planets orbiting star other than our Sun came in 1992, and since then the floodgates of the new announcements have opened: close to 2000 exoplanets in over 1000 individual planetary systems have been detected by the end of 2014. Nowadays, new extrasolar planets are being discovered on an almost daily basis.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0033-2.png" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />
                        
            <p>Detecting these distant worlds is one thing, but getting to them is a different matter entirely. The distances involved are enormous by any standards. The nearest known <i>extrasolar planet</i>, if confirmed, would be in a binary star system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri, binary star system">Alpha Centauri</a> (this <i>exoplanet</i>, <i>Alpha Centauri Bb</i>, is disputed, and is not in the habitable zone around its star anyway) which is 4.4 light years from our Sun and the travel time required to reach this hypothetical world by a starship equipped with presently available propulsion systems would be thousands of years.</p>
            <p>The crew of <i>Endurance</i> bypasses this, seemingly unsolvable, complication by taking a shortcut to the distant galaxy through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole a.k.a. Einstein–Rosen bridge, hypothetical feature of spacetime">wormhole</a>, which conveniently opens near <i>Saturn</i>. Now, this is the biggest sticking point in the script as the <i>wormholes</i> are not only merely hypothetical features of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" title="Spacetime a.k.a. 'space–time continuum', mathematical model combining space and time">spacetime</a>, which were never actually confirmed, let alone observed, either directly or indirectly, but if they exist (and that is a big <i>‘if’</i>) they are: <b>a)</b> <i>far too small</i> as they appear and disappear spontaneously at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale" title="Planck scale">sub-atomic scale</a>; <b>b)</b> <i>not traversable in both directions</i>; <b>c)</b> <i>inherently unstable</i> and would collapse far too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other, with everything that would have fallen through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon" title="Event Horizon a.k.a. 'the point of no return'">event horizon</a> of either universe inevitably crushed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" title="Gravitational Singularity a.k.a. Spacetime Singularity">singularity</a>.</p>
            <p>But hey, this is <i>science fiction</i>, not science fact, so let's pretend for a while that the present theories are wrong and <i>wormholes</i> exist, are stable, and traversable in both directions.</p>
            <p>As our intrepid explorers emerge out of the far end of the <i>wormhole</i> somewhere at the other side of the universe, their task is to explore 3 potentially habitable planets: <i>Edmunds, Mann</i> and <i>Miller</i>, named after the three astronauts of the previous NASA <i>‘Lazarus’</i> missions who surveyed them earlier. <i>‘Lazarus’</i> spacecraft were one-way-only missions – their pilots had no means of returning back to the Earth, but they collected crucial scientific data and left signal beacons allowing future missions to follow up on their discoveries.</p>                        
            <p>They head first for the <i>Miller</i> planet which is orbiting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" title="Black Hole, region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping">black hole</a> named <i>Gargantua</i>, but they soon discover that the planet is so close to the <i>black hole</i> that the gravitational pull causes severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" title="Time dilation, difference of elapsed time between two events as measured by observers (theory of relativity)">time anomaly</a>, meaning that an hour on the surface of <i>Miller</i> is equal to seven years on Earth. <i>Amelia, Cooper, Doyle</i> and <i>CASE</i> descend to the planet in a shuttle and locate the beacon. Unfortunately, the planet proves inhabitable as it is entirely covered by a shallow ocean buffeted by enormous tidal waves caused by a gravitational pull of the <i>Gargantua</i>. Although discouraged by <i>Cooper</i>, <i>Amelia</i> attempts to recover the capsule with <i>Miller's</i> scientific data, when a huge wave hits, killing <i>Doyle</i> and almost drowning her. At the very last moment, <i>Amelia</i> is saved by <i>CASE</i> and the shuttle departs. Alas, the incident delays them and costs them dearly - when they return aboard the <i>Endurance</i>, they learn from (now much older) <i>Romilly</i> that 23 years have passed there.</p>
            <p>Low on fuel, <i>Endurance</i> can now only visit one more planet before returning to the Earth. <i>Amelia</i> believes <i>Edmunds</i> planet has more promising data, but <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Romilly</i> are in favour of <i>Mann</i> planet, as <i>Mann’s</i> beacon is still transmitting. After some argument, the team votes for <i>Mann</i>. When they land, they follow the beacon and soon find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics" title="Cryonics a.k.a. Cryopreservation, low-temperature preservation of humans">cryonically</a> frozen <i>Dr. Mann</i> within a small scientific station on a cold, icy, inhospitable world not unlike Earth’s <i>Antarctica</i>. It soon becomes apparent that <i>Dr. Mann</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon" title="American actor, screenwriter and producer Matt Damon">Matt Damon</a>) faked data about <i>‘his’</i> planet's habitability so that he gets rescued.</p>
            <p>Before he entered his <i>cryo-pod</i>, <i>Mann</i> damaged his AI robot (to conceal the real <i>Mann</i> planet data), and to further cover up his deceit, he takes <i>Cooper</i> for an excursion to a remote area of <i>‘his’</i> planet where he breaks his spacesuit visor and leaves him to die. In the meanwhile, back at the scientific station, <i>Romilly</i> tries to repair <i>Mann’s</i> (unbeknown to him) booby-trapped AI robot and dies in an ensuing explosion.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_cinema/cinema0033-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none; margin-bottom:12px;" />

            <p><i>Mann</i> steals the shuttle and heads for <i>Endurance</i>. <i>Amelia</i> finds <i>Cooper</i> just before his oxygen runs out, rescues him with the other shuttle and they arrive at <i>Endurance</i> just in time to witness <i>Mann</i> attempting the, less-than-perfect, docking. <i>Cooper</i> sees that the docking seal is imperfect and warns <i>Mann</i> against opening the hatch. Needless to say, crazed <i>Mann</i> does not heed his warning and opens the hatch. The airlock depressurises, killing <i>Mann</i> and causing serious damage to <i>Endurance</i>. <i>Amelia</i> gives up any hope, but <i>Cooper</i> uses his test pilot skills to dock the shuttle to the other airlock of <i>Endurance</i>, which is now spinning uncontrollably, and uses the shuttle’s engines to stop <i>Endurance</i> from spinning and get it under control.</p>

            <p>When they realise that, due to the extensive damage, they no longer have enough fuel or resources for the return journey to the Earth,</p>

            <p class="shift_paragraph_up"><i>Cooper</i> and <i>Amelia</i> come up with a plan to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist" title="Gravitational Slingshot a.k.a. Gravity Assist">slingshot</a> <i>Endurance</i> around <i>Gargantua</i> on a course for <i>Edmunds</i>. They also intend to use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and drop a probe with <i>TARS</i> into the <i>black hole</i>, hoping to collect some invaluable scientific data on the <i>singularity</i>. <i>Cooper</i>, realising that he can never return back to the Earth and see his children again (who would be now, courtesy of  <i>Gargantua</i>, the same age as he), takes seemingly one-way ride into the <i>black hole</i> with the <i>TARS</i>. But he couldn't possibly fathom that what was supposed to be an end is just a beginning of his amazing adventure.</p>
