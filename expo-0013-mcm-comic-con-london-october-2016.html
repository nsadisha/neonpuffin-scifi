            <p style="margin-top:8px"><i>London MCM Comic Con</i> is a multi-genre pop-culture convention held in ExCeL, Royal Victoria Dock, London, twice yearly, usually on the last weekend of May and October. The event is organised by the <i>MCM (Movie Comic Media) Expo Group</i>.</p>
            <p>This year won’t be an exception and the autumn convention will take place on the last full weekend of October, i.e. from Friday 28th to Sunday 30th of October 2016.</p>
            <p>The convention focuses primarily on fantasy and science fiction genres across all related media, such as comics, manga, anime, film, television as well as video games and cosplay, with the exhibitors mainly from the United Kingdom and Japan, but also from other countries from all around the world. <i>London MCM Comic Con</i> features a large floor space for corporate exhibitors, which include well-known movie studios and TV stations, as well as a separate section for private exhibitors and assorted dealer stalls. There is also a theatre area with a large stage equipped with projection monitors and seating for audience of approximately 1000.</p>
            <p>The convention is frequently attended by many movie and television show stars as well as various memorable industry personalities and other assorted celebrities mostly from the United Kingdom, but also from numerous other countries from around the world.</p>
            <p>The highlights of the October’s Expo will be: <i>Special Guests</i> (see the <a href="expo-0013-mcm-comic-con-london-october-2016.html#SpecialGuests" title="MCM Comic Con London, October 2016 - Special Guests">detailed list</a> below), <i>Photo with the Stars Area</i>, <i>eSports</i> (featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESL_(eSports)" title="ESL (Electronic Sports League) - an eSports company which organises world-wide video game competitions between professional players">ESL</a> <i>UK Premiership</i>, <i>MCM Street Fighter V Cup</i>, <i>Retro Gaming Tournament</i> and the South regional finals for a chance to participate in this year’s <i>Red Bull 5G</i> in Japan), <i>Pop Asia</i> (fusion of Japanese, Korean & other Asian cultures), <i>Comic Village</i> (Workshop for Comic Creators and Fans alike), <i>Steampunk</i>, <i>Cosplay & Masquerade</i> (including <i>EuroCosplay Championship</i> and <i>The Clara Cow Cosplay Cup</i>), <i>Vidfest UK</i> (an event for fans of online video and web series), <i>Theatre</i> (with previews of upcoming genre-related films and television shows), <i>Retro Gaming</i>, <i>Stalls with Memorabilia</i> and <i>Dealer Stalls</i>.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of cosplayers attend <i>MCM Comic Cons</i> every year, and this October there are two opportunities for them to be selected to represent the UK at two different international cosplay contests:</p>
            <p><b>The EuroCosplay Championships</b></p>
            <p><i>The EuroCosplay Championships</i> feature almost 30 countries from across Europe, with the UK representative selected at the <i>MCM Comic Con Manchester</i> in July 2016.</p>
            <p><b>The Clara Cow Cosplay Cup</b></p>
            <p>A team of two cosplayers will be selected for the final which takes place at <i>Anime 2017</i> in the Netherlands from the 9th to 11th June 2017.</p>
            <p><b>MCM eSports</b></p>
            <p>Another regular event taking place at every <i>MCM Comic Con</i> is <i>MCM eSports</i>, this time hosting not only the regular <i>ESL UK Premiership</i> but also <i>Retro Gaming Tournament</i> and the newly founded <i>MCM Street Fighter V Cup</i>.</p>
            <p>And as if that wasn’t enough, exclusively to this October’s expo, <i>London MCM Comic Con</i> is hosting the South regional finals for a chance to partake in this year’s <i>Red Bull 5G</i> in Japan this December. Inspired by traditional 5 vs 5 martial arts tournaments, <i>Red Bull 5G</i> tries to re-ignite an age old rivalry between East and West when the players choose the region they want to represent in one of five world-renowned games: <i>Hearthstone, League of Legends, Project CARS, Rocket League</i> and <i>Street Fighter V</i>. With the North regional finals having already taken place in Manchester on 9 October, the winners from each regional final will meet in a national showdown in November for their chance to be crowned the national champions and to win an all-expenses paid trip to Japan this December to represent our country at the <i>Red Bull 5G</i>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, alongside the professional tournaments, <i>MCM London Comic Con</i> provides a <i>Free Play Area</i> on all three days of the show with laptops and peripherals provided by <i>MSI Gaming</i>.</p>
            <p><b>VidfestUK</b></p>
            <p>This European event for fans of online video and web series that celebrates all things online, video and social, is also coming back to <i>MCM Comic Con</i>. Thanks to Internet, the ways we communicate and access entertainment have changed enormously in recent years, simplifying routes via which video programs reach their audiences and giving birth to a completely new kind of celebrities in the process – online stars that via their vlogs, uTube channels and Web Series reach hundreds of thousands to millions of their fans, without going anywhere near any of the major TV channels or film studios – and this all without even leaving their bedroom! The event features some of the best known uTubers and vloggers, and covers Web Series, Animations, Comedy Sketches, Music, Geek Videos, Live Streaming, Online Gaming and more.</p>
            <p><b>Nightmare Machines</b></p>
            <p>Among other interesting exhibitors who now attend <i>MCM Comic Con</i> on a regular basis are <i>Nightmare Machines</i> – the team of replica prop builders and cosplayers that tour the UK sci-fi conventions, bringing to audiences their spectacular display props from many well-known movies. Amongst themes they have previously displayed are scenes from the blockbusters <i>Alien, Terminator, Ghostbusters, The Evil Dead</i> and many others. Recently, they are staging a scene from the cult sci-fi comedy film <a href="cinema-0085-back-to-the-future-30th-anniversary.html" title="Back to the Future - 30th Anniversary, feature article">Back to the Future</a> – including <i>Marty McFly, Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown, DeLorean time machine</i> – the works.</p>
            <p><b>The MCM Expo Party</b></p>
            <p>On the Saturday evening of each <i>London MCM Comic Con</i> is held <i>The MCM Expo Party</i> with a chance to get together, dance, eat and drink. This October’s party is undergoing a big change with the aim to make it even bigger than before. Taking place in the ExCeL’s Gold Theatre, the <i>MCM Mega Party</i> has an ambition to be the biggest party for Comic Con fans in the UK.</p>
