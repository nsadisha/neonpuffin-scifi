            <p><i>Mass Effect: Foundation</i> presents 12 short stories written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_%28comics%29" title="Mac Walters, lead writer of the 'Mass Effect' video game trilogy">Mac Walters</a>, lead writer of the <i>Mass Effect</i> trilogy of video games, with the aim to expand the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe and flesh out some of its characters and their background, in order to give more credibility to the key protagonists and events of the games. The majority of the issues were illustrated by <i>Tony Parker</i>, except for issue 1 (<i>Omar Francia</i>), issues 5-6 (<i>Matthew Clark</i>), and issue 7 (<i>Garry Brown</i>). The stunning cover art was created by a French illustrator <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Carr%C3%A9" title="Benjamin Carre, French illustrator">Benjamin Carre</a>.</p>
            <p>The 13th narrative, and the first issue of the comic book series, reveals the background story of <i>Rasa</i> (who is a reoccurring character serving as a joining element of the twelve disjoined stories), before she became an operative of <i>Cerberus</i>, explaining the reasons why she felt compelled to enrol in this secretive pro-human paramilitary organisation.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_comics/comic0002-1.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: none; margin-top:5px;" />

            <p>Next two issues tell the account of <i>Rasa’s</i> first encounter with the <i>Krogan</i> bounty hunter <i>Urdnot Wrex</i> who she chances upon on one of her assignments for <i>Illusive Man</i>, before recounting the episode when <i>Rasa</i> (under a guise of a psychologist counselling the victims of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" title="Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)">PTSD</a>) interrogated <i>Chief Ashley Williams</i> about the attack of <i>Turian Spectre Saren</i> and his <i>Geth</i> army on <i>Eden Prime</i>, where the whole <i>Williams’s</i> squad, along with the 3 other units, fell into ambush and were completely wiped out (with <i>Williams</i> saved by <i>Commander Shepard</i>) after they were sent on a seemingly ordinary mission to secure the excavation site of the unearthed <i>Prothean Beacon</i>.</p>
            <p>Continuing with the background stories of some well known characters of the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe, the fourth issue visits the off-world <i>Biotic Acclimation And Temperance</i> training (<i>BAAT</i>) camp set up on the <i>Gagarin Station</i> (a.k.a. <i>Jump Zero</i>) in 2160s. <i>Kaidan Alenko</i> was one of the youth who, after being exposed to <i>Element Zero</i> and showing promising signs of biotic potential, attended this strict, military-like training camp. The training, supervised by the <i>Turian</i> biotics instructor <i>Commander Vyrnnus</i>, was hard to say the least, and contact with the families back on Earth was kept to minimum. Infamous for his brutal training techniques, <i>Commander Vyrnnus</i> did not hesitate to exercise corporal punishment, as well as subject the trainees to hunger and thirst, whenever he deemed it necessary, to break the recruits both mentally and physically. This however backfired on him one day, when, after he broke the arm of <i>Rahna</i>, <i>Kaidan’s</i> best friend and sweetheart, <i>Kaidan</i> lashed out at the abusive instructor and killed him using his emerging biotic powers.</p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_comics/comic0002-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: none; margin-top:5px;" />

            <p>In the story arc spanning the issues 5 - 6, describing the events shortly after the <i>Battle of the Citadel</i>, <i>Illusive Man</i> briefs <i>Rasa</i> about the disappearance of <i>Normandy</i> and <i>Commander Shepard’s</i> presumed death. Later on, <i>Jacob Taylor</i> - a former <i>Alliance</i> marine, meets <i>Miranda Lawson</i> - a <i>Cerberus officer</i>, who is trying to recruit him for <i>Cerberus</i>. <i>Taylor</i> agrees to take part in a <i>‘taster’</i> mission with the goal to find and bring back <i>Commander Shepard</i> (or what’s left of him) which takes them to <i>Terminus System</i>. While there, <i>Lawson</i> gets ambushed, overpowered and abducted by the <i>Batarian</i> thugs. <i>Taylor</i>, with the help of <i>Lakshmi</i>, a ten-year-old local girl, saves <i>Lawson</i> and in the process liberates dozens of humans held in captivity by the <i>Batarian</i> slavers. Ultimately, their mission ends in failure, as it transpires that the stasis pod with <i>Shepard’s</i> body was already sold to another party.</p>
            <p>The issue 7 visits <i>Jack</i> a.k.a. <i>‘Subject Zero’</i>, an exceptionally gifted female human <i>Biotic</i>, at the moment when <i>Jack</i> revisits the <i>Cerberus Training Facility</i> where she was held against her will and experimented upon as a child. As <i>Jack</i> passes through the facility, wreaking havoc in her wake, killing all the employees and releasing the new trainees, <i>Illusive Man</i> sends in <i>Rasa</i> and <i>Kai Leng</i> to apprehend her and bring her in for questioning. The mission doesn’t go exactly according to plan, as <i>Rasa’s</i> and <i>Kai’s</i> martial skills (however impressive they might be) are no match for <i>Subject Zero’s</i> off-the-charts biotic abilities. In the end, <i>Jack</i> is captured by a <i>Krogan</i> leader of the <i>Blue Sun</i> mercenaries, but not before massacring the rest of the <i>Blue Suns</i> sent in by <i>Illusive Man</i> as a fail-safe precaution.</p>

            <p>Next issue sees <i>Rasa</i> briefed by <i>Miranda Lawson</i> at the <i>Minuteman</i> space station, where she learns about the <i>Lazarus Project</i> – the secret attempt to create <i>Commander Shepard’s</i> clone. <i>Miranda</i> also reveals that in order to rebuild the commander, <i>Cerberus</i> requires one final piece of information – <i>Shepard’s</i> classified records stored at the <i>Spectre Offices</i> on <i>Citadel</i>.</p>
            <p>To retrieve the information, <i>Rasa</i> meets <i>Tela Vasir</i>, an <i>Asari Spectre</i>, under the ruse of bringing her a disc with valuable, highly classified information about <i>Cerberus</i> (unknown to <i>Vasir</i>, the information on the disc is, in fact, outdated). However, <i>Vasir</i> sees through the deception, and <i>Rasa</i> is caught in the act of retrieving the classified files from the spectre’s computer. <i>Vasir</i> offers <i>Rasa</i> an opportunity to work for her as a double agent (or being blacklisted as a criminal throughout the galaxy) with an assignment to deliver a spyware-loaded disc with the <i>Shepard’s</i> classified records to <i>Cerberus</i>.</p>
            <p>After despondent <i>Rasa</i> visits a bar to try and drown her despair in booze, her day just gets better when she unwittingly accepts a spiked drink from a patron. When she wakes up some days later back on the <i>Minuteman</i> station, <i>Miranda</i> retrieves her disc and, despite <i>Rasa’s</i> feeble protests, inserts it into a computer. Spectre’s virus triggers, but is quickly deactivated by skilful <i>Miranda</i>, who manages to retrieve the <i>Shepard’s</i> classified records. <i>Illusive Man</i> acknowledges that, with her cover blown, <i>Rasa</i> can no longer work as an agent of <i>Cerberus</i>. However, he devises for her a new purpose: <i>Commander Shepard</i> will need a new team and <i>Rasa’s</i> responsibility will be to assure that he will get the best team members possible.</p>

            <p>In the issue 9, bed-bound <i>Rasa</i> reluctantly accepts a task to go through the personal files of the potential candidates for the members of <i>Shepard’s</i> crew. The first person she investigates is <i>Salarian Mordin Solus</i>. <i>Dr Solus</i>, a brilliant, fast-thinking and fast-talking scientist, always guided by scientific principles and logic rather than morals, is the one responsible for modifying and strengthening the <i>Genophage</i> - a viral contagion causing the sterility of the <i>Krogans</i>, a fast-breeding, warlike alien race. <i>Salarians</i> are very wary of the <i>Krogan</i> expansion and devised the <i>Genophage</i> as a way of controlling the fast-growing <i>Krogan</i> population. However, after some time, <i>Krogan</i> females developed a partial resistance to this, morally questionable, <i>‘birth control method’</i> and this issue brings <i>Dr Solus</i> to <i>Tuchanka, Krogan</i> homeworld, where he is testing the effects of the new strain of the <i>Genophage</i> on a small <i>Krogan</i> settlement.</p>

            <p>Issue 10 follows <i>Kasumi Goto</i>, <i>Master Thief</i>, and her lover <i>Keiji Okuda</i>, as they attempt a daring heist at the <i>Donovan Hock's</i> property on the planet <i>Beckenstein</i>. <i>Hock</i> is an avid art collector, with the corridors, halls and vaults of his property crammed with dozens of priceless artefacts and exceptional works of art. At first, everything seems to be going according to the plan as <i>Kasumi</i> fools the security guards and the two make their way into the vault. Unfortunately, <i>Keiji</i> is caught off-guard by <i>Hock</i>, who fatally stabs him and steals his <i>Graybox</i> (a device containing a collection of snapshots of one's memories). As <i>Kasumi</i> kneels over the body of dying <i>Keiji</i>, she vows to avenge his death and retrieve his memories so they can be together again.</p>

            <p>Throughout the issues 11 - 12, <i>Rasa</i>, still under medical observations and not cleared for the field work, continues compiling data on the <i>Shepard’s</i> team: First dossier contains the information about <i>Zaeed Massani</i>, infamous bounty hunter and mercenary, who was once heading the <i>Blue Sun</i> mercenary outfit, before starting to work for <i>Shadow Broker</i>. His biggest assignment was an attempt to hijack and crash the flagship of the Turian’s 8th Fleet, <i>War Frigate Verrikan</i>. To accomplish this audacious objective, <i>Zaeed</i> put together a team of 3 mercenaries plus an inside man – a <i>Turian</i> commander, whose love for his superiors has gone sour. Not everything went according to the plan, but, despite losing all members of his team, <i>Zaeed</i> finished the job. Second dossier deals with <i>Thane Krios</i>, a renowned <i>Drell</i> sniper and professional assassin working for his <i>Hanar</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome" title="Patronage - relationship (as in ancient Roman society) between the patron and his client(s)">patron</a> (A few hundred years ago, the <i>Hanar</i> rescued several hundred thousand <i>Drell</i> from their overcrowded, dying planet and brought them to the <i>Hanar</i> homeworld <i>Kahje</i>, where the <i>Drell</i> integrated into the <i>Hanar</i> society as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome" title="Patronage - relationship (as in ancient Roman society) between the patron and his client(s)">client</a> race of the <i>Hanar</i>). <i>Thane’s</i> training began at the tender age of six. At first, <i>Thane</i> found it difficult to kill people, but as the time passed by, he learned to be remorseless and detached from his actions. Until one day. That day, <i>Thane</i> was about to pull the trigger to terminate an old <i>Salarian</i> war criminal, who he had firmly in the sights of his sniper rifle, when a beautiful female <i>Drell</i> stepped into the line of fire, warned his would-be-victim, and spoiled the assassination attempt. <i>Thane</i>, wondering who was this mysterious brave woman, not afraid to step between a stranger and a bullet, started to question the morality of his profession. He began to shadow the woman, until one day, when her life was in danger, he intervened and saved her. <i>Irikah</i>, for that was her name, forgave <i>Thane</i> after he promised that he will put his past behind him, and they soon married and had a son. <i>Thane</i> kept good on his promise, and persuaded his <i>Hanar</i> patron to release him from his <i>Compact</i> (a contract between the <i>Hanar</i> patron and <i>Drell</i> client). <i>Thane</i> tried to find a job in order to support his fledgling family, but with no qualification, he was offered only unskilled labour work, and soon resolved to freelance again. One day, <i>Thane</i> fulfilled a contract to eliminate a <i>Batarian</i> leader of a slavery ring. <i>Batarian</i> slavers vowed revenge, but cowards that they are, they took an indirect route. They waited until <i>Thane</i> went away on one of his assignments and brutally murdered his wife, shortly after she managed to hide their son from the assailants. <i>Thane</i>, after hunting down and killing every one of the cowardly murderers, realised that his <i>Hanar</i> patron was right, when he once said: <i>“We all must walk paths we are given”</i>.</p>

            <p>The last issue sees <i>Rasa</i> betraying <i>Cerberus</i> and making away with the pod containing <i>Shepard’s</i> clone, despite <i>Lawson’s</i> best effort to stop her. <i>Lawson</i> wants to send a retrieval team to go after the traitor, but she is stopped by <i>Illusive Man</i>, who tells her that they better concentrate on the impending threat posed by the <i>Reapers</i> and retrieval of the real <i>Shepard’s</i> body.</p>
            <p>While the main goal of this comic book series - to expand the <i>Mass Effect</i> universe, was undoubtedly realised, one cannot help but feel that the storytelling isn’t as convincing as in some other, previous attempts, for instance <i>Mass Effect: Redemption</i>. The background stories too, are a bit of a hit-and-miss affair, with some much more convincing than others. As far as <i>Rasa</i> (who, as you may remember, is a character that was invented in the first issue as a joining element of the remaining twelve issues) goes, she feels pretty real in the first two issues, but later on her appearances start to feel less and less plausible, until by the issue 13 this character seems to be just this – <i>a joining element</i>.</p>

            <p>The artwork is mostly solid, with the majority of the <i>Mass Effect</i> regulars instantaneously recognisable, but the quality of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inker" title="Inking - part of a traditional comic book production process">inking</a>, which is immaculate in most of the issues, is a tad ropy in some (notably in the issues 4 and 8).</p>
            <p>Overall, <i>Mass Effect: Foundation</i> is a worthy addition to the <i>Mass Effect</i> folklore.</p>
