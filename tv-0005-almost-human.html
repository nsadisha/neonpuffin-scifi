            <p><i>Almost Human</i> is an American science fiction / crime drama series created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._H._Wyman" title="Joel Howard 'J. H.' Wyman, American-born Canadian actor and screenwriter">J. H. Wyman</a> (of <i>Fringe</i> television series fame), produced by <i>Frequency Films</i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Robot_Productions" title="Bad Robot Productions - American film and television production company owned by J. J. Abrams">Bad Robot Productions</a> and distributed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television" title="Warner Bros. Television - the television production arm of Warner Bros. Entertainment (itself part of Time Warner)">Warner Bros.</a>. The series aired from November 2013 to March 2014.</p>

            <p>As in the year 2048 the uncontrollable advancement of science and technology caused crime rates to rise an astounding 400%, the strained police force has implemented a new radical strategy: every police officer is paired with a humanoid android.</p>
            <p><i>John Kennex</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban" title="Karl-Heinz Urban, a New Zealand actor">Karl Urban</a>), is a troubled detective, who has a very good reason to hate these new robot partners. Some two years previously, <i>Kennex</i> and his squad were raiding the hideout of a criminal gang known as the <i>‘Insyndicate’</i>, but ended up being ambushed and outgunned. When <i>Kennex’s</i> partner got badly injured, and <i>Kennex</i> tried to help him, the accompanying android abandoned them both because he calculated that the wounded man’s chances of survival were very low and it wouldn’t have been ‘logical’ to try to save him. An ensuing explosion killed the injured officer and took off <i>Kennex’s</i> leg.</p>
            <p>After waking up from a 17-month coma, <i>Kennex</i> has to deal not only with his cybernetic prosthetic leg and huge gaps in his memory (which he tries to recover through visits to a shady memory-recovery doctor called a <i>‘Recollectionist’</i>), but also coming to terms with being betrayed by <i>Anna</i>, his former girlfriend.</p>
            <p>To help him to recuperate, <i>Captain Sandra Maldonado</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Taylor" title="Lili Anne Taylor, American film and television actress">Lili Taylor</a>) recalls <i>Kennex</i> back to the force, and partners him with a standard-issue <i>MX-43</i> android policeman. Their partnership doesn’t last long however. When the android chastises <i>Kennex</i> and threatens to report him for breaking the regulations, he gets thrown out of the moving vehicle onto the road, where he is hit by oncoming traffic and destroyed.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_tv/tv0005-2.png" alt="" title="" style="border:none; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:12px;" />

            <p>Detective <i>Kennex</i> is issued with a replacement android, an older <i>DRN</i> model decommissioned for police work and about to be transferred to the space station. Usage of the <i>DRN-model</i> androids for police work proved troublesome, as they were designed to be as close to human as possible, which unfortunately also meant that they sometimes had trouble dealing with their own emotional responses, what was the main reason why they were eventually replaced by the cold-logic-based <i>MX</i> units.</p>
            <p><i>Kennex</i> initially treats his <i>DRN</i> unit with the same disdain as other androids, but <i>Dorian</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ealy" title="Michael Ealy (born Michael Brown), American actor">Michael Ealy</a>), as the android wants to be called, proves unique – not only intelligent, but also friendly, witty and much more human-like than the standard-issue <i>MX</i> units – and gradually grows on <i>Kennex</i>, although he would absolutely loathe to admit it. The partnership between <i>Kennex</i> and <i>Dorian</i> then provides the main framework for the story arc of the show.</p>
            <p>Supported by a team consisting of detective <i>Richard Paul</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Irby" title="Michael Clinton Irby, American film and television actor">Michael Irby</a>), geeky, but skilful technician <i>Rudy Lom</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Crook" title="Paul James 'Mackenzie' Crook, English film, television and stage actor">Mackenzie Crook</a>), and rather attractive detective <i>Valerie Stahl</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minka_Kelly" title="Minka Dumont Kelly, American actress">Minka Kelly</a>) who is a love interest for the main protagonist, <i>Kennex</i> and <i>Dorian</i> deal during the course of the 13-episode series with cases that involve tailored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent" title="Tailored biological weapons - biological agents designed to affect only specific ethnic groups or sub-groups of society">biological weapons</a> targeting only policemen, android prostitutes with human skin, high-tech <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft" title="Identity theft - assuming someone's identity by pretending to be that person">identity theft</a> involving face projection device, a deadly new drug called <i>‘the bends’</i>, illegal human cloning, illicit trade in synthetic human organs, attention-seeking cyber criminal, assassins using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_bullet" title="Smart bullet - a projectile that is capable of doing something other than simply following its given trajectory, for example changing its course during flight">precision-guided bullets</a> capable of changing direction mid-flight, rogue combat android that goes on a rampage, mysterious deaths of genetically engineered girls linked to a new designer drug, automated house with homicidal tendencies, a serial killer stealing attractive facial features from his victims and transferring them onto his face, and yet another, seemingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_crime#Criminals" title="Copycat serial killers - criminals whose act is modelled on, or inspired by, previous serial murderers">copycat serial killer</a>, stuffing the empty abdomens of his victims with straw, in a fashion strikingly similar to the method used by the killer caught by <i>Kennex’s</i> father 10 years previously and now serving a life sentence for the murders.</p>

            <p>Despite the series receiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Awards - awards recognising excellence in the television industry">Emmy Awards</a> nomination for <i>Outstanding Special and Visual Effects</i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="Fox Broadcasting Company - American commercial broadcast television network owned by the Fox Entertainment Group division of the 21st Century Fox">Fox</a> cancelled the show after the first season citing high production costs and low ratings.</p>
