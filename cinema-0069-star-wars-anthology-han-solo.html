            <p><i>“This is the first film we’ve worked on that seems like a good idea to begin with. We promise to take risks, to give the audience a fresh experience, and we pledge ourselves to be faithful stewards of these characters who mean so much to us. This is a dream come true for us. And not the kind of dream where you’re late for work and all your clothes are made of pudding, but the kind of dream where you get to make a film with some of the greatest characters ever, in a film franchise you’ve loved since before you can remember having dreams at all.”</i> says the double-act of American filmmakers.</p>
            <p>The screenplay for the feature film will be written by yet another pair of filmmakers, father-son tandem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan" title="Lawrence Edward Kasdan, American film screenwriter, director and producer">Lawrence</a> & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kasdan" title="Jonathan 'Jon' Kasdan, American screenwriter and director">Jon Kasdan</a>. <i>Lawrence Kasdan</i> is best known as the co-writer of two films from the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy – <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, as well as action-adventure film <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, another cult movie starring <i>Harrison Ford</i>.
