            <div id="draw_title_header_black_background">B.J.’s saga continues with 'Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus'</div>

            <p><i>William Joseph ‘B.J.’ Blazkowicz</i>, the main protagonist of the <i>Wolfenstein</i> series of alternative history video games, is back in <i>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</i>. Set in America in 1961, <i>‘The New Colossus’</i> will take <i>BJ</i> (nicknamed <i>‘Terror-Billy’</i> by the Nazis) from post-nuclear-attack Manhattan via small-town Roswell to the bayous and boulevards of New Orleans and beyond, as he leads the resistance against the Nazi occupation of his beloved country.</p>
            <p>After barely surviving the assassination of Nazi General <i>Deathshead</i> at the end of <i>‘Wolfenstein: The New Order’</i>, <i>BJ</i> begins his new adventure while still recovering from his extensive injuries. Bloodied but unbowed, he soon finds himself fully recovered and stronger than ever. Along the way, <i>BJ</i> will mow down anyone in his path using an extensive arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including the <i>Laserkraftwerk</i> (laser-based weapons) or the <i>Dieselkraftwerk</i> (fuel-powered grenades). <i>BJ</i> can also get up close and personal with his enemies using the new hatchet – because there’s nothing more satisfying than plunging a sharp axe into the brittle cranium of an unsuspecting Nazi commandant.</p>

            <p>Whatever weapons he chooses to use, <i>BJ</i> can not only dual-wield anything from advanced pistols to submachine guns (or any other combo of his powerful armaments), but he can upgrade those weapons as well – allowing for even bigger versatility when he engages in his favourite pastime: killing vile Nazis.</p>
            <p>But <i>‘The New Colossus’</i> isn’t just the tale of one man’s mission to rid USA of the foul sowers of the evil ideology that’s overtaken his nation. <i>BJ</i> this time fights to take back his homeland alongside his old friends (including returning favourites like <i>Caroline, Bombate, Set, Max Hass, Fergus</i> and <i>Wyatt</i>, as well as his now-pregnant partner <i>Anya</i>). These allies – along with new characters like <i>Horton</i> and <i>Grace</i> – will help <i>BJ</i> take down the villainous <i>Frau Engel</i> and her Nazi army, in the process sparking the second American Revolution, and ensuring there’s a future for the growing <i>Blazkowicz</i> family.</p>
            <p><i>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</i> puts you into the Nazi-stomping boots of <i>BJ Blazkowicz</i> and lets you unleash your inner resistance fighter. Whether you like to sneak around, run-and-gun, take a tactical approach – or prefer combination of all of the above – your goal remains the same: rally the opposition and end the Nazis’ tyrannical reign in America.</p>
