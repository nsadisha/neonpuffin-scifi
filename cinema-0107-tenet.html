            <p>his sci-fi action thriller film was written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" title="Christopher Jonathan James Nolan, English-American film screenwriter, director and producer">Christopher Nolan</a> who, with the critically acclaimed blockbusters such as <i>Inception</i> and <a href="cinema-0033-interstellar.html" title="Interstellar - review of the epic science fiction film">Interstellar</a> under his belt, is no stranger to science fiction genre. Although <i>Tenet</i> doesn’t reach the heights of the former two films, it delivers on its promise of multi-layered intrigue and high-octane temporal action.</p>

                The film’s name and plot references are borrowed from the ancient Sator Square – a palindrome with four symmetries (i.e. the text can be read in four directions).
            </div>

            <p>The film’s name, and partly also its plot, revolves around the ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square" title="Sator Square - a two-dimensional five-word Latin palindrome with four symmetries">Sator Square</a>, a five-by-five letter square made up of five 5-letter Latin words, forming a two-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome" title="Palindrome - a sequence of characters which reads the same forward as well as backward">palindrome</a> with four symmetries (i.e. the text can be read top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, left-to-right, or right-to-left).</p>
            <p>The storyline starts unfolding at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv" title="Kyiv a.k.a. Kiev - capital and most populous city of Ukraine">Kyiv</a> Opera House (the 4th word of the Sator Square), where the <i>‘Protagonist’</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_David_Washington" title="John David Washington, American actor and former football running back">John David Washington</a>), a secret agent, participates in an undercover operation with the aim to retrieve an <i>‘artefact’</i>, when things go wrong and his life is saved by a masked soldier with a trinket on a red string, who seemingly ‘un-fires’ a bullet (i.e. the bullet flies backwards from the wall and into the barrel of soldier’s gun) through a hostile gunman.</p> 
            <p style="margin-bottom: 25px">Some time later, the <i>Protagonist</i> joins a secret organization called <i>Tenet</i> (the 3rd word of the Sator Square), where a scientist shows him bullets with ‘inverted entropy’ allowing them to move backwards in time. Aided by a local contact <i>Neil</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pattinson" title="Robert Pattinson, English actor">Robert Pattinson</a>), the <i>Protagonist</i> traces the bullets to Indian arms dealer <i>Priya Singh</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimple_Kapadia" title="Dimple Kapadia, Indian actress predominantly appearing in Hindi films">Dimple Kapadia</a>) who reveals that the bullets are indeed of her provenance, but they were purchased and time-inverted by Russian oligarch <i>Andrei Sator</i> (the 1st word of the Sator Square) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh" title="Sir Kenneth Charles Branagh, Northern Irish actor and filmmaker">Kenneth Branagh</a>).</p>
            <p>To gain access to <i>Sator</i>, the <i>Protagonist</i> approaches his estranged wife <i>Katherine ‘Kat’ Barton</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Debicki" title="Elizabeth Debicki, French-born Australian actress">Elizabeth Debicki</a>), an art appraiser, and learns that she unknowingly sold <i>Sator</i> a Goya drawing that was an imitation by a forger named <i>Arepo</i> (the 2nd word of the Sator Square) and <i>Sator</i> now uses the counterfeited drawing to blackmail her, thus keeping her under his control. <i>Kat</i> agrees to introduce the <i>Protagonist</i> to <i>Sator</i>, in return for which he promises to steal the drawing from a free port facility at Oslo Airport. As the vault housing the drawing boasts a practically impenetrable high-end security, the <i>Protagonist</i> and <i>Neil</i> come up with a daring plan involving crashing a <i>Boeing 747</i> airliner into the facility.</p>

                The Protagonist and Neil try to steal a forged Goya drawing from the secure vault at Oslo Airport, when they come across two locked doors, marked blue and red.
            </div>

            <p>There, behind blue and red marked doors leading to a room divided in the middle by a glass partition into two equally large parts, they find a peculiar turnstile that suddenly produces two masked men – a normal-timeline one on <i>Neil’s</i> side and a time-inverted one, who promptly attacks the <i>Protagonist</i>. The <i>Protagonist</i> only barely manages to fend off the time-inverted hostile, but not before he <i>‘un-fires’</i> several rounds from the glass partition, around <i>Protagonist’s</i> head, and into the barrel of his handgun. The name of the free port’s security firm, <i>Rotas</i> (the 5th word of the Sator Square) that means in Latin <i>“turm”</i> or <i>“rotate”</i> gives a final clue that the strange turnstile is in fact a future-tech device able to time-invert not only objects but also persons.</p>
            <p><i>Kat</i> introduces the <i>Protagonist</i> to <i>Sator</i> on his super-yacht, but <i>Sator</i>, to <i>Kat’s</i> vexation, shows her the intact drawing. When the <i>Protagonist</i> saves <i>Sator’s</i> life after <i>Kat</i> pushes him overboard during a high-speed catamaran race, <i>Sator</i> asks him to help retrieve a case he says contains Plutonium-241 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn" title="Tallinn - capital and the most populous city of Estonia">Tallinn</a>. The <i>Protagonist</i> and <i>Neil</i> ambush an armoured convoy and during an elaborate nerve-racking highway chase steal the case, which in fact does not contain nuclear material, but rather the <i>artefact</i> lost during the Kyiv Opera House botched operation. No sooner they get hold of the contraband than they are ambushed by time-inverted <i>Sator</i>, who holds <i>Kat</i> hostage and demands the artefact.</p>

                    Behind the blue door, the Protagonist finds a peculiar turnstile that produces a time-inverted man, who attacks him and ‘un-fires’ several rounds around his head.
                </div>

            <p>The <i>Protagonist</i> gives <i>Sator</i> an empty case and saves <i>Kat</i>, but is captured and taken to <i>Sator's</i> warehouse. There, time-inverted <i>Sator</i> shoots and mortally wounds <i>Kat</i>, while normal-timeline <i>Sator</i> demands the location of the artefact, to which the <i>Protagonist</i> gives him false information.</p>

            <p><i>Tenet</i> operatives led by <i>Ives</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Taylor-Johnson" title="Aaron Perry Taylor-Johnson, English actor best known for portrayal of the title character in film Kick-Ass">Aaron Taylor-Johnson</a>) rescue the <i>Protagonist</i> but <i>Sator</i> manages to escape. The group takes <i>Kat</i> through the time-inverting turnstile, reversing the effects of her wound, thus saving her life. Then, the <i>Protagonist</i> time-inverts himself, returns to the ambush site on Tallinn highway and gives <i>Sator</i> a chase. Alas, his vehicle is overturned, and <i>Sator</i> sets it on fire, but the <i>Protagonist</i> is again saved by <i>Ives’s</i> team. Then he and <i>Neil</i> travel back to the free port facility at Oslo Airport. There, the <i>Protagonist</i> fights off his past self (realising that the masked man from the first encounter here was actually himself) and enters the time-inverting turnstile to time-revert himself to the normal timeline.</p>
            <p><i>Priya</i> explains to the <i>Protagonist</i> that a female scientist in the future discovered an <i>'Algorithm'</i> – a mathematical formula capable of inverting the entropy of the whole world. The scientist that found the <i>Algorithm</i> was so distraught by the catastrophic and irreparable implications of such a discovery that she committed suicide so that it never can be used. Before killing herself however, she rendered the <i>Algorithm</i> into nine physical objects – the <i>artefacts</i> – which she then time-inverted and sent back in time to be hidden at some of the most thoroughly guarded places there are – alongside nuclear arsenal of the nine nuclear powers. Given that <i>Andrei Sator</i> was from <i>Stalsk-12</i>, where he was hired to handle a clean-up of a nuclear accident, those in the future chose him as their handler for transferring time-inverted objects to the past, as they realised that he should be one of a very few people who would be foolish enough to enter this extremely dangerous irradiated zone.</p>

                At Sator's warehouse, behind time-inverting turnstile, ‘backward’ Sator shoots Kat, while ‘forward’ Sator demands the location of the artefact from the Protagonist.
            </div>

            <p><i>Kat</i> reveals that <i>Sator</i> is dying from pancreatic cancer and that he plans to trigger the <i>Algorithm</i> with a dead man’s switch, taking the whole world with him. She believes that he will kill himself during their holiday in Vietnam, when they were last time in love and happy together. The <i>Protagonist, Neil, Kat</i>, and the <i>Tenet</i> armed forces time-travel back to that day, so that <i>Kat</i> can delay <i>Sator’s</i> death, while <i>Tenet</i> forces secure the <i>Algorithm</i> and disable it. Split in a two groups, normal-timeline red team and time-inverted blue team, <i>Tenet troops</i> descend in a <i>‘temporal pincer’</i> manoeuvre on <i>Sator’s</i> hometown of <i>Stalsk-12</i> in Northern Siberia. The <i>Protagonist</i> secures the <i>Algorithm</i>, but not before he is aided by a blue-team trooper, with a trinket on a red string attached on his backpack, who dies while saving the <i>Protagonist</i> from <i>Sator’s</i> bodyguard <i>Volkov</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Kolokolnikov" title="Yuri Andreyevich Kolokolnikov, Russian stage, television and film actor">Yuri Kolokolnikov</a>). Simultaneously, in Vietnam, <i>Kat</i> boards <i>Sator’s</i> yacht and kills him.</p>

            <p>The <i>Protagonist, Neil</i>, and <i>Ives</i> break up the <i>Algorithm</i> into several separate parts, thus rendering it unusable, and part ways. Only then the <i>Protagonist</i> notices the trinket on a red string hanging from <i>Neil’s</i> rucksack and realises that it was him all along who saved his life both in the Kyiv Opera House and in <i>Stalsk-12</i>.</p>
