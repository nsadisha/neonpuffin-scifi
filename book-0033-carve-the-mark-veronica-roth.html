            <p style="margin-top:20px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Roth" title="Veronica Roth, American writer known for her young adult fiction novels">Veronica Roth</a>, known for her young adult fiction books, in particular for her trilogy of dystopian sci-fi novels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_trilogy" title="The Divergent trilogy - a series of young adult science fiction novels by American novelist Veronica Roth, set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian Chicago">Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant</a>, leads her readers on another journey into her imaginary worlds in <i>‘Carve the Mark’</i>, the first book in the planned duology of novels published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins" title="HarperCollins Publishers LLC - one of the world's largest publishing companies">HarperCollins</a>.</p>
            <p>The storyline of <i>‘Carve the Mark‘</i> revolves around two youngsters, <i>Cyra Noavek</i> and <i>Akos Kereseth</i>. Although the <i>Shotet</i> people and the <i>Thuvhe</i> nation (to which <i>Cyra</i> and <i>Akos</i> respectively belong) live on the same planet, they hardly could be more different.</p>
            <p>The <i>Thuvhe</i>, who call the planet likewise, are a peace-loving nation who lives in the cold north, while the more violent <i>Shotet</i> people, who train their children in warfare and carve marks in their skin to denote every kill, call their homeworld <i>Urek</i> and live in the warmer equatorial region of the planet.</p>
            <p>On this planet, where violence rules and vengeance is the law, a force called the <i>‘current’</i> flows through every living being, eventually emerging from within people as <i>‘currentgifts’</i>. Everyone develops this <i>‘currentgift’</i>, a unique power meant to shape the future, but while most benefit from their gifts, <i>Akos</i> and <i>Cyra</i> do not – their <i>currentgifts</i> actually make them vulnerable to others’ control.</p>
            <br/>
            <p style="margin-top:-15px"><i>Cyra</i> is the sister of the brutal tyrant who rules the <i>Shotet</i> people. Her currentgift gives her pain and power – something her brother exploits, using it to torture his enemies. But, unbeknown to her ruthless brother, <i>Cyra</i> is much more than just a blade in his hand: she is quick on her feet, resilient, and much smarter than he realises.</p>
            <p><i>Akos</i>, son of an oracle and a farmer from the village of <i>Hessa</i>, is from the peace-loving nation of <i>Thuvhe</i>, and his loyalty to his family is limitless. Although protected by his unusual <i>currentgift</i>, once <i>Akos</i> and his brother are captured by the enemy <i>Shotet</i> soldiers, <i>Akos</i> is desperate to get his brother out alive, no matter what the cost.</p>
            <p>When <i>Akos</i> is thrust into <i>Cyra’s</i> world, the enmity between their nations and families seems insurmountable. In the face of this, they must decide to help each other to survive – or to destroy one another. Can <i>Akos</i> and <i>Cyra</i> reclaim their gifts, their lives and their fates, while helping to reset the balance of power in their world?</p>
            <p><i>HarperCollins</i>, who described the two-book series of novels as <i>“the story of a boy who forms an unlikely alliance with an enemy”</i>, is planning to publish the second book in the series sometime in 2018.</p>

            <p><i>'Carve the Mark'</i> is out from 17 January 2017 in hardcover (480 pages) with RRP $22.99 (£18.50), also available as audiobook and e-book.</p>
