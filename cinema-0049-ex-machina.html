            <p>A young lad <i>Caleb Smith</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson" title="Domhnall Gleeson, Irish actor">Domhnall Gleeson</a>), a programmer at an Internet search giant <i>Blue Book</i>, wins a competition to spend a week at the remote, private mountain retreat of the company’s prodigious but reclusive CEO, <i>Nathan Bateman</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Isaac" title="Oscar Isaac Hernandez, Guatemalan-born American actor">Oscar Isaac</a>). Upon his arrival, <i>Caleb</i> learns that there is much more to the lucrative prize than enjoying his host’s hospitality and hanging out with one of the brightest minds of his generation. <i>Nathan</i> has chosen him to be the human component in a <i>Turing Test</i>-like experiment, charging <i>Caleb</i> with evaluating the capabilities, intelligence and ultimately the presence of consciousness of <i>Nathan’s</i> latest model of artificially intelligent android.</p>

                Ava is a highly advanced android whose artificial intelligence emerges from the billions of expressions typed daily into the world’s biggest Internet search engine.
            </div>

            <p><i>Caleb</i> is soon ushered to a room with a shatterproof glass partition in the middle and introduced to <i>Ava</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Vikander" title="Alicia Amanda Vikander, Swedish actress and a former ballerina">Alicia Vikander</a>), a highly advanced humanoid android whose artificial intelligence emerges as a product of the billions of expressions the millions of humans are typing into <i>Blue Book</i>, the world’s biggest Internet search engine. When asked, <i>Ava</i> tells <i>Caleb</i> that he is the first man she met apart from <i>Nathan</i>, and that she spent her whole (short) life in the small room on the other side of the unbreakable glass wall, often dreaming about going out and finding a busy pedestrian intersection in a city, where she can observe ordinary people going about their daily lives.</p>
            <p>When questioned by <i>Nathan</i> about his first impressions, <i>Caleb</i> says that he is immensely awed, but he voices his reservations as to the validity of the <i>Turing Test</i>, since he can see the tested subject. (In the real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" title="Turing Test, a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour indistinguishable from that of a human">Turing Test</a> all participants are separated from each other (e.g. by a partition), so that the tester cannot see whether he deals with a human or an AI. The tester then engages in natural language conversation with the subject: a human or an AI designed to generate answers indistinguishable from that of a human being. If the tester cannot reliably tell the AI from the human, the AI has passed the test.) <i>Nathan</i> agrees, but explains that they are long past the <i>Turing Test</i> stage. He wants <i>Caleb</i> to evaluate <i>Ava</i> and, at the end of the evaluation, let him know whether he still thinks that <i>Ava </i>possesses a self-aware thought-process and expresses a human-like behaviour, despite knowing beforehand that she is a mere android endowed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial Intelligence, the intelligence exhibited by machines or software">Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>
            <p><i>Caleb</i> meets with <i>Ava</i> again and she starts flirting with him. There is a power cut and <i>Ava</i>, taking an advantage of the fact that the CCTV cameras which <i>Nathan</i> uses to observe their interactions are offline, unexpectedly lowers her voice and warns <i>Caleb</i> not to trust <i>Nathan</i>. She also reveals to <i>Caleb</i> that it is her who is causing these power blackouts.</p>
            <p>Intrigued, <i>Caleb</i> asks <i>Nathan</i> what he will do with <i>Ava</i> should she fails the test, and he says that her AI will be updated with a newer version, resulting in her memory being wiped out. This is an upsetting prospect for <i>Caleb</i> who during the testing sessions develops a fondness for <i>Ava</i>.</p>

                Caleb asks Nathan what he will do with Ava should she fails the test, and he says that her AI will be updated with a newer version, resulting in her memory wipe-out.
            </div>

            <p>Throughout his final session with <i>Ava</i>, and during yet another power failure, <i>Caleb</i> reveals to her that he plans to re-program the security system so that during the power outage, instead of locking all the doors, the system will open them all. He explains to <i>Ava</i> that he intends on using <i>Nathan’s</i> fondness for a tipple and getting <i>Nathan</i> stone-drunk before locking him in his room. He asks <i>Ava</i> to trigger a power cut next day at 10 o’clock in order to escape with him.</p>

            <blockquote class="black" style="width: 330px; float: left;">
                <span>
                    Ex Machina asks the ultimate questions: What is intelligence; How you define self-awareness; and: What makes us human.
                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The next morning <i>Caleb</i> wants to go through with his plan and pours a drink for <i>Nathan</i> proposing a toast, but he refuses to drink and reveals to <i>Caleb</i> that he became increasingly suspicious about the power blackouts, and, not being a simpleton, hid a battery-powered camera inside <i>Ava’s</i> room, and therefore saw through <i>Caleb’s</i> plan. <i>Nathan</i> also admits that <i>Ava’s</i> facial features were modelled on <i>Caleb’s</i> sexual preferences, resourced from his web porn searches.</p>
            <p>But the biggest shock comes when <i>Caleb</i> learns that he, in fact, did not win any competition. The whole thing was a stitch-up and he was chosen solely because he is a single, girlfriend-less, goody two-shoes deemed to be best suited for a final test of <i>Ava’s</i> self-awareness, with <i>Nathan</i> devising a trial where <i>Ava</i> must exploit <i>Caleb</i> in order to escape, using all she’s got: intelligence, cunningness, even her sexuality.</p>
            <p>This also answers the question which <i>Caleb</i> posed previously, i.e. whether <i>Nathan</i> programmed <i>Ava’s</i> AI to flirt with him, reasoning that it ought to be either this, or the flirting must be self-emergent, which would be a proof of <i>Ava’s</i> self-awareness. <i>Nathan</i> then told him that there is also a third possibility, that is, <i>Ava</i> might <i>pretend</i> that she is infatuated with him.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_white align_left" style="text-align: left; width: 902px;"> <!-- image width + 2 -->
                <img src="images_cinema/cinema0049-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border: 1px solid black;" />
                By the end, Caleb’s mind is so messed-up that he starts to question if he himself isn’t an android playing a part in some Nathan’s twisted AI test.
            </div>

            <p><i>Nathan</i> concludes that <i>Ava</i> is not in love with <i>Caleb</i>, but is only using him as means of escape, and he celebrates this as the final proof that she is truly artificially intelligent and self-aware, deeming the test a resounding success. That is, only until the moment when the clock hits 10:00, the power goes off, and <i>Nathan</i>, to his sheer horror, learns that <i>Caleb</i> reprogrammed the security system already the previous day.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the emotional intelligence of <i>Ava</i> proves vastly more sophisticated, human-like and therefore also deceptive than the two men could have ever imagined.</p>

            <p>The film, directorial debut of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Garland" title="Alexander Medawar 'Alex' Garland, English screenwriter, director and producer">Alex Garland</a>, (who is a screenwriter of several other outstanding science fiction films, <i>28 Days Later, Sunshine</i> and <i>Never Let Me Go</i> amongst others) is a stylish and clever science fiction thriller, that deals with the similar issues as the not-accidentally similarly-named British sci-fi film <a href="cinema-0004-the-machine.html" title="The Machine, 2013 British science fiction thriller film">The Machine</a> (which packs in a lot more action scenes but lacks the depth and sophistication of <i>Ex Machina</i>), that is: <i>What is intelligence</i>; <i>How you define self-awareness</i>; and ultimately: <i>What makes us human</i>. Highly recommended.</p>
