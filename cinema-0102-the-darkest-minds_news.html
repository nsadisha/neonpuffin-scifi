            <p><i>Ruby Daly</i> is one of the few lucky ones who have survived the outbreak of mysterious disease that had decimated most of America’s children a few years ago, but as she wakes up in the morning of her tenth birthday, she realises that her miraculous immunity didn't come without a high price to pay. Something about her had fundamentally changed – somehow, inexplicably, she has acquired powerful supernatural abilities which are however completely beyond her control. Abilities so frightening that her own parents lock her up in the garage and call for the police.</p>

            <p>Now sixteen years old, <i>Ruby</i> lives in <i>Thurmond</i>, a brutal government <i>‘rehabilitation camp’</i>, where she is kept interned with other kids like her. While the abilities of all youngsters are considerable, it is <i>Ruby</i> whose paranormal skills are most powerful, making her stand out from the other detainees of the facility. Desperate to find the rumoured safe haven for special youth like her – <i>‘East River’</i>, <i>Ruby</i> escapes <i>Thurmond</i> and joins a group of children who have run away from another, similar camp. But when they finally arrive at <i>East River</i>, nothing is as it seems, least of all the refuge’s mysterious leader. Moreover, there are other forces at work –  people who will stop at nothing to use <i>Ruby</i> in their fight against the corrupt government. <i>Ruby</i> finds herself facing a terrible choice – one that may mean giving up her only chance of having a normal life worth living…</p>
