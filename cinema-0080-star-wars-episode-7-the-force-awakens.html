            <p><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i> (a.k.a. <i>Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens</i>) is an epic space opera science fiction film co-written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams" title="Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, American screenwriter, director, producer and composer">J. J. Abrams</a>, who also co-produced the film with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm" title="Lucasfilm Ltd - an American film and television production company">Lucasfilm</a> via his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Robot_Productions" title="Bad Robot Productions - American film and television production company owned by J. J. Abrams">Bad Robot Productions</a> company. The film was distributed worldwide by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures" title="Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures - an American motion picture distribution division owned by The Walt Disney Company">Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures</a>.</p>
            <p>The seventh instalment in the main sequence of <i>Star Wars</i> films, <i>The Force Awakens</i> is set approximately 30 years after <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The main storyline follows <i>Rey, Finn</i>, and <i>Poe Dameron</i>, as they fight alongside the <i>Resistance</i>, led by veterans of the <i>Rebel Alliance</i>, against <i>Kylo Ren</i> and the <i>First Order</i> – a military group that emerged from the remnants of the <i>Galactic Empire</i>, and their search for <i>Luke Skywalker</i>.</p>

                Rey, a scavenger living in a junkyard settlement, suddenly finds herself in the centre-point of galactic events when she befriends BB-8, astromech droid with a secret.
            </div>

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Walton Lucas, American filmmaker best known as the creator of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises">George Lucas</a>, the original creator of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, discussed ideas for a sequel trilogy several times after the conclusion of the new prequel trilogy, but denied any intent to ever turn it into reality. When he finally sold his production company <i>Lucasfilm</i>, and with it the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company - multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in Burbank, California, USA">The Walt Disney Company</a> in October 2012, standing by <i>Lucasfilm’s</i> new president, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_%28producer%29" title="Kathleen Kennedy, American film producer and President of Lucasfilm">Kathleen Kennedy</a>, <i>Lucas</i> said: <i>“I always said I wasn’t going to do any more [Star Wars sequels] and that’s true, because I’m not going to do any more, but that doesn’t mean I’m unwilling to turn it over to Kathy to do more.”</i></p>
            <p>Several directors were considered for what would be the first live-action film in the franchise since <i>Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith</i> was released in 2005, including <i>David Fincher, Brad Bird</i> and <i>Guillermo del Toro</i>, until finally after a suggestion by <i>Steven Spielberg</i> to <i>Kathleen Kennedy, J. J. Abrams</i> was named director in January 2013, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan" title="Lawrence Edward Kasdan, American screenwriter, director and producer, best known as a co-writer of several Star Wars films">Lawrence Kasdan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Kinberg" title="Simon David Kinberg, English-born American screenwriter and film producer">Simon Kinberg</a> as project consultants.</p> 
            <p>Initially, <i>George Lucas</i> attended early story meetings as a creative consultant for the film, advised on the details of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe and even turned over to the production team his rough story ideas for the Episodes VII–IX, but he later stated that <i>Disney</i> had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film. After the release of the film in December 2015, <i>Lucas</i> voiced his disappointment with the direction the film ended up going in, being quoted as saying: <i>“They wanted to do a retro movie. I don’t like that. Every [previous Star Wars] movie, I worked very hard to make them different ... I made them completely different – different planets, different spaceships to make it new."</i> However, the film was very well received by die-hard fans of the franchise who agreed with <i>Abrams</i>, who felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film <i>“needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain”</i> and intentionally used paraphernalia, characters and plot elements from the previous <i>Star Wars</i> films.</p>

            </div>

            <p><i>Episode VII’s</i> first screenplay was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arndt" title="Michael Arndt, American screenwriter">Michael Arndt</a>, who worked on the script for eight months, but then said he needed eighteen more, which was far more time than <i>Abrams</i> and <i>Disney</i> could give him. Consequently, <i>Abrams</i> and <i>Kasdan</i> took over script duties after the production announced <i>Arndt’s</i> exit from the project in October 2013, and in January 2014 <i>Abrams</i>, who felt that the key to the success was to return to the roots of the first <i>Star Wars</i> film, with its emphasis on emotion rather than explanation, confirmed that the script was complete.</p>
            <p><i>Abrams</i> later clarified that he purposely withheld some plot elements from <i>Episode VII</i>, such as <i>Finn</i> and <i>Rey’s</i> last names and their backgrounds and <i>Kennedy</i> admitted that <i>“we haven’t mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet”</i>, but added that <i>Abrams</i> is collaborating with <i>Episode VIII</i> director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rian_Johnson" title="Rian Craig Johnson, American screenwriter, producer and director">Rian Johnson</a>, and then <i>Johnson</i> will similarly cooperate with <i>Episode IX</i> director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow" title="Colin Trevorrow, American screenwriter and director">Colin Trevorrow</a>, to ensure a smooth transition and continuity and <i>“that everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this”</i>.</p>
            <p>Filming on <i>The Force Awakens</i> began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place in Ireland and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_Studios" title="Pinewood Studios - a film studio located in  Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom">Pinewood Studios</a> in England, and concluded in November 2014 (During the filming at <i>Pinewood, Harrison Ford</i> famously injured his leg after a heavy hydraulic door on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> set fell on him, and production needed to be suspended for a couple of weeks). Other locations used for filming were the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Greenham_Common" title="Royal Air Force Greenham Common - a former Royal Air Force base and airfield in Berkshire, England">RAF Greenham Common</a> military base in Berkshire, Puzzlewood in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_Dean" title="Forest of Dean - geographical region in the western part of the county of Gloucestershire, England, UK">Forest of Dean</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellig_Michael" title="Skellig Michael (a.k.a.

            </div>

            <p>Reportedly, draconian secrecy on the set has caused considerable frustration for actors – the script was printed in black ink on paper of the deepest red so that it couldn’t be photocopied, and it was taken from the actors and locked away in a safe in-between the takes. Additionally, paparazzi and fans alike were flying drones over Pinewood studios, trying to take photographs, so whenever an actor or a prop was being moved between the sets, they had to be covered in a blanket or opaque sheet.</p>

            <p>The events of <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i> are set approximately 30 years after the destruction of the second <i>Death Star</i>. <i>Luke Skywalker</i>, the last <i>Jedi</i>, has disappeared, and his twin sister, <i>General Leia Organa</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher" title="Carrie Frances Fisher, American actress best known for portraying Princess Leia in Star Wars films">Carrie Fisher</a>), leads the <i>Resistance</i> against the <i>First Order</i>, the military grouping that has risen from the ashes of the fallen <i>Galactic Empire</i> and that seeks to eliminate the <i>New Republic</i>.

            <p>At the beginning of the film, <i>Resistance</i> pilot <i>Poe Dameron</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Isaac" title="Oscar Isaac (born Óscar Isaac Hernández Estrada), Guatemalan-American actor and musician">Oscar Isaac</a>) meets village elder <i>Lor San Tekka</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Sydow" title="Carl Adolf 'Max' von Sydow, Swedish actor with French citizenship">Max von Sydow</a>) on the planet <i>Jakku</i>, in order to obtain a holographic star map pointing to <i>Luke’s</i> location. <i>Stormtroopers</i> under the command of <i>Kylo Ren</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Driver" title="Adam Douglas Driver, American actor">Adam Driver</a>) who get wind of the meeting, attack and destroy the village and capture <i>Poe</i>, however his droid <i>BB-8</i> manages to escape with the map, and is later befriended by <i>Rey</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Ridley" title="Daisy Jazz Isobel Ridley, English actress">Daisy Ridley</a>), a scavenger living in a junkyard settlement.</p>
            <p><i>Kylo Ren</i> brings <i>Poe</i> aboard star destroyer <i>Finalizer</i>, where he tortures him using the <i>Dark Side</i> of the <i>Force</i>, and learns of <i>BB-8</i> and his precious cargo. <i>Stormtrooper FN-2187</i>, later named by <i>Poe ‘Finn’</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyega" title="John Boyega, British actor">John Boyega</a>), who is unable to bring himself to kill innocents for the <i>First Order</i>, frees <i>Poe</i>, and they together escape in a hijacked <i>TIE fighter</i>. However, the <i>TIE fighter</i>, badly damaged by a volley of fire from the star destroyer, crash-lands on <i>Jakku</i>, with <i>Finn</i> appearing to be the only survivor. <i>Finn</i> hides in a nearby settlement, where he encounters <i>Rey</i> and <i>BB-8</i>, but before long, the <i>First Order</i> tracks them down and launches an airstrike from two <i>TIE fighters</i>. <i>Finn, Rey</i> and <i>BB-8</i> run for their lives and eventually flee their pursuers in a stolen, rundown spaceship, which turns out to be the legendary <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.</p>

            <p>The <i>Millennium Falcon</i> breaks down, and is captured by a larger spaceship piloted by <i>Han Solo</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford, American actor best known for his roles as Han Solo in Star Wars films and the title character of the Indiana Jones film series">Harrison Ford</a>) and his Wookiee crewmate <i>Chewbacca</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mayhew" title="Peter Mayhew, English actor of American citizenship, best known for portraying Wookiee Chewbacca in Star Wars films">Peter Mayhew</a>), who reclaim their long-lost vessel. Gangs of rogues board the ship, adamant to settle the score with <i>Han Solo</i>, but the five manage to escape in the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>. While the gang members inform the <i>First Order</i> of <i>Han’s</i> involvement, at the <i>First Order’s</i> <i>Starkiller</i> base, a whole planet converted to a monstrous, deadly super-weapon capable of destroying entire star systems, <i>Supreme Leader Snoke</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis" title="Andrew Clement 'Andy' Serkis, English actor, director and author">Andy Serkis</a>) orders <i>General Hux</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson" title="Domhnall Gleeson, Irish actor">Domhnall Gleeson</a>) to use the weapon for the first time. <i>Snoke</i> also questions <i>Kylo Ren’s</i> loyalty, since, as we learn, <i>Han Solo</i> is in fact his father, to which <i>Kylo</i> states that <i>Han</i> means nothing to him.</p>
            <p>When the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> crew examine <i>BB-8’s</i> star map, they determine that it is incomplete. <i>Han</i> explains that <i>Luke</i> tried to rebuild the <i>Jedi Order</i> but condemned himself to a self-imposed exile at an unknown location, after a <i>Jedi</i> apprentice turned to the <i>Dark Side</i> and destroyed all what <i>Luke</i> had built. They continue their search on the planet <i>Takodana</i> where they meet with cantina owner <i>Maz Kanata</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupita_Nyong'o" title="Lupita Amondi Nyong'o, Mexican-Kenyan actress">Lupita Nyong'o</a>), a diminutive creature sporting oversized goggles and displaying keen affection for <i>Chewbacca</i>, who can help <i>BB-8</i> reach the <i>Resistance</i>. In the meanwhile, <i>Rey</i> is subconsciously drawn to a vault where she finds the lightsaber that once belonged to <i>Luke Skywalker</i> and his father <i>Anakin</i> before him. After <i>Rey</i> experiences some disturbing visions and flees into the woods, <i>Maz</i> gives the lightsaber to <i>Finn</i> for safekeeping.</p>

            <p><i>Starkiller</i> base is activated and destroys the capital of the <i>New Republic</i>, after which the <i>First Order</i> storms <i>Takodana</i> in search of <i>BB-8</i> and the star-map it carries. <i>Han, Chewbacca</i> and <i>Finn</i> are saved by a squadron of <i>X-wing fighters</i> led by <i>Poe</i>, who, as it turns out, survived the <i>TIE-fighter</i> crash. <i>Leia</i> and <i>C-3PO</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Daniels" title="Anthony Daniels, English actor, best known for portraying the droid C-3PO in Star Wars films">Anthony Daniels</a>) arrive at <i>Takodana</i> where they reunite with <i>Han</i> and <i>Chewbacca</i>. Meanwhile, in the heat of the fighting, <i>Kylo</i> manages to capture <i>Rey</i> and takes her to the <i>Starkiller</i> base, where he also interrogates her about the map, but finds that she is able to resist his mind-reading powers. Discovering that she, too, can use the <i>Force</i>, <i>Rey</i> escapes her confinement after playing a neat <i>Jedi</i> mind trick on her jailers.</p>
            <p>Later, at the <i>Resistance</i> outpost on <i>D’Qar</i>, <i>BB-8</i> encounters <i>R2-D2</i>, who has been inactive since <i>Luke’s</i> disappearance. As <i>Starkiller</i> base prepares to fire on <i>D’Qar</i>, the <i>Resistance</i> devise an audacious plan to destroy the super-weapon by attacking its Achilles heel. Before they leave for the daring mission, <i>Leia</i> urges <i>Han</i> to return their son alive. Using the <i>Millennium Falcon, Han, Chewbacca</i> and <i>Finn</i> infiltrate the facility. They lower its force shields, reunite with <i>Rey</i> and, after they set explosive charges, encounter <i>Kylo Ren</i>. <i>Han</i> confronts <i>Kylo</i>, calling him by his birth name - <i>Ben</i>, and implores him to abandon the <i>Dark Side</i>, but <i>Kylo</i> tricks his father and pierces him with his lightsaber. Enraged with grief, <i>Chewbacca</i> shoots at <i>Kylo</i> and sets off the explosives, allowing the <i>Resistance</i> pilots aboard <i>X-wing fighters</i> to attack the base and set in motion a chain reaction that will ultimately destroy the <i>Starkiller</i> base.</p>

            <p>The injured <i>Kylo</i> pursues <i>Finn</i> and <i>Rey</i> all the way to the surface of the planet that houses the <i>Starkiller</i> base. <i>Finn</i> attempts to tackle <i>Kylo</i> with <i>Luke’s</i> lightsaber, but, being no match for his <i>Dark Force</i> skills, is soon overpowered and badly wounded. <i>Rey</i> picks up the lightsaber <i>Finn</i> dropped and confronts <i>Kylo</i>, very nearly overpowering him with the <i>Force</i> she wields, but suddenly they are separated by a deep crevice as the whole planet starts falling apart. Before the entire <i>Starkiller</i> base disintegrates, <i>Snoke</i> orders <i>Hux</i> to evacuate and bring <i>Kylo Ren</i> to him for further training, while <i>Rey</i> and <i>Chewbacca</i> escape with gravely injured <i>Finn</i> in the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.</p>
            <p>On <i>D’Qar</i>, the <i>Resistance</i> celebrates their victory even as <i>Leia</i> and <i>Chewbacca</i> mourn <i>Han’s</i> death. Unexpectedly, <i>R2-D2</i> re-activates and reveals the missing part of the star-map. <i>Rey</i> with <i>Chewbacca</i> and <i>R2-D2</i> follow the map that leads them to a distant planet, where, on a remote island <i>Rey</i> finally finds <i>Luke Skywalker</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hamill" title="Mark Richard Hamill, American actor and voice actor, best known for portraying Luke Skywalker in Star Wars films">Mark Hamill</a>) and presents him with his lightsaber.</p>
