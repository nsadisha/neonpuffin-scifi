            <p>The series, which will serve as a prequel to the new film adaptation, will focus on the secretive matriarchal order <i>Bene Gesserit</i>, a key religious, social and political force in <i>Dune</i> universe. The order is an exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to attain seemingly superhuman abilities and powers that can seem almost magical to outsiders. Acolytes who have acquired the full breadth of <i>Bene Gesserit</i> knowledge and skills  are called <i>Reverend Mothers</i> within the organization’s ranks, with the most recent example being the Emperor's Truthsayer <i>Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam</i>, (as portrayed in the 2021 film adaptation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Rampling" title="Tessa Charlotte Rampling, English actress and former model">Charlotte Rampling</a>).</p>

            <p>To ensure the continuity between the film and series, <i>Denis Villeneuve</i> will direct the series’ pilot episode, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spaihts" title="Jon Spaihts, American author and screenwriter">Jon Spaihts</a> writing the screenplay and <i>Dana Calvo</i> serving as showrunner for the series. <i>Villeneuve</i> and <i>Spaihts</i> will also serve as executive producers alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Herbert" title="Brian Patrick Herbert, known for writing (with author Kevin J. Anderson) multiple prequels to his father's science fiction novel Dune">Brian Herbert</a>, <i>Kim Herbert</i> (original book author <i>Frank Herbert’s</i> son and granddaughter respectively) and <i>Byron Merritt</i>. In November 2019, <i>Spaihts</i> left the series as script writer to focus more on the planned <i>Dune</i> sequel film, although he will remain as an executive producer. The series’ filming was planned to begin on 2 November 2020 on the sets in Budapest, Hungary and Jordan; however this was most likely pushed back due to the ongoing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" title="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) - a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), First identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019">COVID-19</a> epidemic.</p>
