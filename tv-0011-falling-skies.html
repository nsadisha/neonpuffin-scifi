            <p><i>Falling Skies</i> is a post-apocalyptic science fiction television series created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rodat" title="Robert Rodat, American film and television screenwriter">Robert Rodat</a>, executive produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Allan Spielberg, American influential filmmaker">Steven Spielberg</a> and broadcast on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_%28TV_channel%29" title="Turner Network Television (TNT), American cable and satellite television network">TNT</a> television network.</p>

                Tom Mason (portrayed by Noah Wyle), who was before the invasion a history professor at Boston University and now is the second-in-command of the 2nd Mass, and his partner Anne Glass (played by Moon Bloodgood), a former paediatrician and now the unit’s doctor, are two of the main protagonists of the show.
            </div>

            <p>The setting for the series is the Earth in the aftermath of a global alien invasion. The war was swift and devastating. In just a few days the technologically vastly-superior alien invaders overcome the militaries of all the world’s superpowers, destroyed all the major cities, neutralised the power grid and communication, and killed over 90% of the human population.</p>
            <p>The main alien attack force consists of huge bipedal robotic attack drones called <i>‘Mechs’</i> and six-legged, oversized-insect-like creatures known to humans as <i>‘Skitters’</i>, who seem to be the foot-soldiers of the alien invaders. At the top of the alien hierarchy are  the enigmatic <i>Espheni</i> a.k.a. <i>‘Overlords’</i>, the masters of the <i>Skitters</i>, and the actual masterminds of the invasion.</p>
            <p>To consolidate their hold on power, and at the same time form a local blindly-obeying front-line army, the aliens round up all the children and attach biomechanical mind-control devices onto their spines. The invaders then use these so called <i>‘harnesses’</i> to control the children’s minds. The <i>‘harness’</i> fuses seamlessly with the spine of the child and any attempt to remove it generally results in the death of the host.</p>
            <p>The show revolves around the exploits of the <i>2nd Massachusetts Militia Regiment</i> (a.k.a. <i>2nd Mass</i>), a makeshift unit of former military and civilians fleeing post-apocalyptic Boston following an alien invasion that devastated the planet and wiped out over 90% of the humankind approximately six months before the events of Season 1. The <i>2nd Mass</i> rallies the remnants of the populace and with the help of the <i>Volm</i> (another alien species at war with the <i>Espheni</i>, that bears a strong resemblance to humans, bar the reptilian-like skin, who made their first appearance at the very end of the final episode of Season 2) try and fight back the alien invaders.</p>

            <p>At the start of the first episode of the fourth season, the <i>2nd Massachusetts</i> eventually arrive back in Charleston, but their celebrations are cut short when they find themselves under a surprise <i>Espheni</i> attack. The <i>2nd Mass</i> is split apart by the fierce attack, many people die (though, conveniently, all the main characters survive), scores are injured and many more, including <i>Tom</i> and <i>Hal Mason</i>, <i>Colonel Weaver</i> and <i>John Pope</i>, are captured by the invaders and confined to a shabby ghetto.</p>
            <p>In absence of <i>Colonel Weaver</i> and <i>Tom Mason</i>, <i>Anne</i> assumes the charge of the <i>2nd Mass</i> and leads the remnant of the unit on an attack against an <i>Espheni</i> convoy, expecting it to contain a shipment of weapons, but is surprised to find children inside the truck instead. After <i>Anne</i> learns that the children know nothing of <i>Lexi</i>, she decides to take a chance and travel in the assumed direction of the truck.</p>
            <p><i>Ben</i> and <i>Maggie</i> in the meantime wind up in the Chinatown, and after finding out that the place is a safe haven, for whatever reason untouched by the <i>Espheni</i>, <i>Ben</i> meets now grown up <i>Lexi</i>. Meanwhile, <i>Matt</i>, alongside other children, is placed in a Nazi-like <i>Espheni</i> re-education camp.</p>
            <p>Back at the ghetto, the captives concoct a plan to scale the force-field fence surrounding the compound in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage" title="Faraday Cage or Faraday Shield, an enclosure formed by a mesh of conductive material, blocking external electric fields by channeling electricity around the mesh">Faraday Suit</a>, disconnect the fence from the power source and escape, while <i>Anne</i> leads the <i>2nd Mass</i> to the Chinatown, where she reunites with <i>Ben</i>, <i>Lexi</i> and <i>Lourdes</i>.</p>

                Matt Mason is placed in a Nazi-like re-education camp, where the Espheni collaborators teach the children to blow the whistle on their parents (literally!). 
            </div>

            <p><i>Tom</i> and the rest of the escapees regroup at the <i>Volm</i> hideout where they are met by their <i>Volm</i> ally <i>Cochise</i>, who reveals that they have managed to find the location where the <i>Espheni</i> keep <i>Matt</i> and other children. <i>Tom</i>, along with <i>Weaver</i> enters the <i>Espheni</i> re-education camp and rescues <i>Matt</i>.</p>
            <p>After a series of mishaps, the <i>Mason</i> family, as well as what is left from the <i>2nd Mass</i>, reunite in the Chinatown, where <i>Lexi</i>, encouraged by devout <i>Lourdes</i>, runs a religious cult that preaches that humans and the <i>Espheni</i> can live alongside each other in harmony. <i>Lexi</i> unexpectedly cocoons-up, causing <i>Maggie</i> voicing her concerns about <i>Lexi</i> and her supernatural powers, and <i>Pope</i> suggesting that they kill her.</p>
            <p><i>Lexi</i> eventually emerges from her cocoon and reveals to her family that she is leaving them because of her doubts about human nature. <i>Lourdes</i> begs <i>Lexi</i> to take her with her, but <i>Lexi</i>, desensitised by her <i>Espheni</i> traits, instead kills <i>Lourdes</i> out of pity and leaves to live with the <i>Espheni</i>. Soon after, the <i>2nd Mass</i> are faced with the news that a large <i>Espheni</i> force is assembled just outside the Chinatown ready to attack. Members of the <i>2nd Mass</i> erect barricades and lay traps around their position in preparation for the assault. During the attack, <i>Maggie</i> uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite" title="Thermite, a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxide">Thermite</a> to destroy some <i>Mechs</i>, but then a tragedy strikes when a ruptured gas pipeline explodes and kills most of the <i>2nd Mass</i>. With the Chinatown in ruin, <i>Tom</i> orders the <i>2nd Mass</i> survivors to retreat to an underground shelter, telling them that the attack won’t end until the <i>Espheni</i> believe that they are all dead.</p>
            <p>As the remnants of the <i>2nd Mass</i> come out from the underground bunker and search the rubble for survivors, they find <i>Maggie</i> who is seriously injured and paralyzed. When an injection of spine fluid from a previously harnessed individual has no effect on <i>Maggie’s</i> condition, <i>Ben</i> suggests to <i>Anne</i> that she implants some of his harness spikes into <i>Maggie’s</i> spine. <i>Anne</i>, though initially concerned for both <i>Ben</i> and <i>Maggie</i>, eventually agrees, uses <i>Volm</i> technology to perform the operation and <i>Maggie</i> is soon walking again as if nothing happened. That night, <i>Tom</i> and <i>Hal</i> notice a strange, out of place, green light on the Moon.</p>

                Lexi Glass-Mason’s allegiance swings wildly between her devotion to her biological parents and loyalty to her Espheni ‘adoptive father’. 
            </div>

            <p>Analysing the strange light on the Moon, <i>Tom</i> and <i>Cochise</i> realise that it is a laser beam emanating from a power hub, beaming the energy down to Earth, and that the energy source that powers the entire <i>Espheni</i> war machine they were looking for the whole time here on Earth, is in fact on the Moon. After some consideration, they decide to fly to the Moon aboard the small <i>Espheni</i> spacecraft they have discovered under the rubble previously, to try and destroy the power generator.</p>
            <p><i>Tom</i> takes matter-of-factly that it will be him who embarks on, clearly suicidal, mission, but the rest of the <i>2nd Mass</i> demand that he offers them a vote on who should pilot the <i>Espheni</i> craft on the mission to the Moon. That night, with the whole <i>2nd Mass</i> gathered, <i>Tom</i> draws <i>Ben’s</i> name, and then his own. <i>Anne</i> believes that he rigged the draw, which <i>Tom</i> admits, reasoning that as a father he couldn’t let <i>Ben</i> go alone. The following day, the members of the <i>2nd Mass</i> find themselves under a renewed <i>Espheni</i> offensive, but are unexpectedly saved by <i>Lexi</i> who comes to their help and destroys the assailants with her supernatural abilities.</p>
            <p><i>Lexi</i>, seeking redress for her wrongs, offers to join <i>Tom</i> on the Moon mission. Her suggestion is initially met with mistrust and scepticism, but <i>Weaver</i> likes the idea and gradually persuades the rest. Notwithstanding, <i>Hal</i> still doesn’t trust <i>Lexi</i> and gives <i>Tom</i> a powerful poison to use on <i>Lexi</i> as a last-resort measure. The <i>Espheni</i> craft eventually departs with <i>Tom</i> and <i>Lexi</i> aboard.</p>

                Creepy-looking ‘Skitters’, six-legged insectoid alien race enslaved by the Espheni, are the foot-soldiers of the invading force. 
            </div>

            <p>Just as <i>Tom</i> with <i>Lexi</i> approach the Moon, and the power hub finally comes into view, their vessel is intercepted by an <i>Espheni</i> ship. In an ensuing skirmish, <i>Tom</i> manages to inject the poison intended for <i>Lexi</i> into the <i>Overlord</i>, killing him, but not before the <i>Overlord</i> destroys their ship’s autopilot. Seeing no other alternative to destroy the power hub, <i>Lexi</i> decides to manually pilot the <i>Espheni</i> ship on a collision course with the hub. <i>Tom</i> and <i>Lexi</i> say their farewells and <i>Lexi</i> prepares for her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze" title="Kamikaze, (from Japanese: 'divine wind') - suicide attacks of military aviators from the Empire of Japan against Allied military targets, mostly naval vessels">kamikaze</a>-style mission, but they are ambushed by a squadron of <i>Espheni</i> ships. Fortunately, a <i>Volm</i> battleship arrives just in time and takes the <i>Espheni</i> attackers out, giving <i>Lexi</i> the opportunity to finally destroy the power hub, but the resulting explosion knocks <i>Tom’s</i> vessel into deep space.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, the 2nd Mass spreads their decimated forces to defend their position, when an <i>Espheni</i> craft drops a new model of harnesses which are able to attach themselves onto human hosts without the need for a dedicated facility (as was the case with the original models). The members of the 2nd Mass put up a defiant yet hopeless fight against the live-like harnesses. When everything seems to be lost, the energy supply from the destroyed power hub on the Moon suddenly ceases to flow and the harnesses, and all other <i>Espheni</i> technology, lose power.</p>
            <p>The next morning, <i>Cochise</i> reports the success of the Moon mission, but also breaks the sad news about <i>Tom</i> lost in the depths of space. <i>Hal</i> rallies the remnants of the <i>2nd Mass</i> to go on a decisive offensive against the weakened <i>Espheni</i>. Elsewhere, <i>Tom</i> awakens aboard an unfamiliar spaceship and is greeted by an alien who he seems to be acquainted with...</p>

                Mechs, Espheni bipedal robotic attack drones, make an imposing and formidable foe – luckily, they are also really terrible, terrible shots. 
            </div>

            <p>Although riddled with cliches (brave Americans kicking arse of alien nasties), right up to and including Season 3, <i>Falling Skies</i> was a fairly entertaining show. Since Season 4 though, the series started going downhill. The plot is becoming increasingly more and more naive and the showrunners seem to be running out of ideas, often resorting to sloppiness. (Some examples could be the captured <i>Espheni</i> spacecraft which, just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" title="Tardis (acronym for Time And Relative Dimension In Space), a space-time machine in the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who, notorious for having its interior much larger than it appears from the outside">Tardis</a>, is clearly much smaller on the outside than it is on the inside, and paralysed <i>Maggie</i>, who miraculously recovers after an impromptu implant of three spikes from <i>Ben’s</i> harness into her spine. Also, considering that this is an end-of-civilisation scenario, all the main protagonists are suspiciously well made-up (save perhaps for <i>Pope</i> and always scruffy-looking <i>Colonel Weaver</i>) with the make-up sets and lipsticks seemingly aplenty in this post-apocalyptic world.)</p>

				<a href="review_policy.html"><img src="images/score-4.png" alt="" title="" /></a>
			</div>

            <p>Last, but not least, the <i>Espheni</i> seem to be very dim-witted for a space-faring civilisation and conquerors of the worlds, being outwitted time and time again by <i>Tom Mason</i> and the <i>2nd Mass</i>, and their <i>Mechs</i>, bipedal robotic attack drones, are really terrible shots, frequently shooting left and right of their intended targets. Perhaps it is really about time to wrap this show up.</p>
            <p><i>Falling Skies</i> was renewed for a fifth and final season, consisting of 10 episodes, returning in June 2015.</p>
