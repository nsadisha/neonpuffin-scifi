            <p><i>Cloverfield Lane</i> is a science fiction psychological thriller directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Trachtenberg" title="Dan Trachtenberg, American filmmaker">Dan Trachtenberg</a> in his directorial debut, from screenplay by <i>Josh Campbell</i>, <i>Matthew Stucken</i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Chazelle" title="Damien Sayre Chazelle, American film screenwriter and director">Damien Chazelle</a>. The film was produced by <i>J. J. Abrams’s</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Robot_Productions" title="Bad Robot Productions - American film and television production company founded by J. J. Abrams">Bad Robot Productions</a> and distributed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures Corporation - American film studio, television and motion picture production company, and one of the 'Big Six' film studios of Hollywood">Paramount Pictures</a>. It is the second film in the <i>Cloverfield</i> franchise, though it is not a direct sequel of the former movie. The film was originally developed from a script titled <i>‘The Cellar’</i>, but under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams" title="Jeffrey Jacob 'J. J.' Abrams, American film screenwriter, director, producer and music score composer">J. J. Abrams’s</a> supervision, it was turned into a <i>‘spiritual successor’</i> of his 2008 sci-fi film <i>Cloverfield</i>, although in contrast to its predecessor’s ‘found footage’ style, <i>10 Cloverfield Lane</i> is presented in a more traditional third-person point of view. The whole film was shot on an ‘ultra low’ budget of about $5-10 million with only three main actors, on only one set, in New Orleans, Louisiana, in just under 2 months between October and December 2014, proving that a good science fiction film doesn’t necessarily need a huge budget and an ensemble of triple-A Hollywood stars.</p>

                Monsters come in many forms: After regaining her consciousness following a car accident, Michelle finds herself locked in an underground bunker belonging to a stranger who insist that she cannot leave, because a hostile event of unknown origin, that took place in the meantime, has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable.
            </div>

            <p>The story centres on <i>Michelle</i>, played by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead" title="Mary Elizabeth Winstead, American actress">Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a>, a young woman who, after a car accident she was involved in, regains her consciousness only to find out that she is held against her will in an underground bunker which she shares with two men who insist that a hostile event of unknown origin, that took place while she was unconscious, has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable.</p>
            <p>First of the men, portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Goodman" title="John Stephen Goodman, American actor">John Goodman</a>, introduces himself as <i>Howard Stambler</i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" title="Conspiracy theory - a belief that secret conspirators or organisations manipulate major world events">conspiracy-theorist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism" title="Survivalism - a movement of individuals or groups (called survivalists or preppers) who are actively preparing for emergencies, such as possible disruptions in social or political order">survivalist</a> and the owner of the underground shelter the three now occupy. He informs <i>Michelle</i> that after an unspecified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction" title="Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) - nuclear, chemical, biological or other weapons that can kill significant number of humans and/or cause great damage to human-made structures">WMD</a> attack has taken place, he was racing to reach the safety of his bunker, when he lost control of his vehicle and caused an accident that was involving also <i>Michelle’s</i> car. Having had pangs of conscience, he took unconscious <i>Michelle</i> into his vehicle, drove her to his shelter and that’s how she happens to be here.</p>

                Michelle quickly finds out that regardless whether she believes Howard’s story or not, she can’t leave on her own will, as the entrance door is secured by padlocks.
            </div>

            <p><i>Michelle</i> has deep doubts about <i>Howard’s</i> story (not helped by the fact that he keeps her handcuffed to the wall and locked in a small room), but not wanting to anger her captor, thanks him for saving her life and asks to be released so that she can go to a hospital and receive proper medical attention. <i>Howard</i> gives her keys to her handcuffs, while stressing that there is nowhere to go, as air outside is contaminated with an unknown agent and everyone else apart from them is dead or dying from exposure. <i>Michelle</i> quickly finds out that regardless whether she believes <i>Howard’s</i> story or not, she can’t leave on her own will, as the entrance door is secured by several solid padlocks.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Shortly afterwards <i>Michelle</i> meets the third, and also the last, occupant of <i>Howard’s</i> underground sanctuary, <i>Emmett DeWitt</i>, who is depicted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gallagher_Jr." title="John Howard Gallagher Jr., American film, television and stage actor and musician">John Gallagher, Jr.</a>. <i>Emmett</i> explains that he in fact helped to build <i>Howard’s</i> sophisticated shelter, featuring its own power generator, air filtration system and running water supply, as well as years-lasting stock of canned food, and, being aware of its existence, immediately after the attack ran straight here, and was reluctantly let in by its owner.</p>

                Michelle realises that Howard’s story must be at least partially true when she sees a woman, suffering from skin lesions, through the window in the shelter’s door.
            </div>

            <p>During the dinner, <i>Michelle</i> manages to distract <i>Howard</i>, steals his keys and tries to make run for the exit, but just as she is about to open the last padlock on the airlock, she sees on the other side of the door a woman, suffering from severe skin lesions, banging her head against the glass porthole and demanding to be let in. <i>Michelle</i> realises that <i>Howard’s</i> story must be at least partially true, and, after <i>Howard’s</i> pleading, decides against opening the airlock and instead returns back to the shelter.</p>
            <p>The trio begins adapting to living underground, settling into their daily routines and passing time by listening to music, playing board games, eating main meals prepared by <i>Howard</i> in the common room and talking about their pre-apocalyptic lives. In one of such conversations with <i>Howard</i>, <i>Michelle</i> learns of his daughter <i>Megan</i>. This daily ritual is interrupted one day, when the air filtration unit breaks down. <i>Howard</i> asks <i>Michelle</i>, who is of a smaller build than the two men, to climb through the air ducts to the secondary airlock and reboot the ventilation system. <i>Michelle</i> successfully reaches the room, restarts the air filtration, but just as she wants to return, she notices the word <i>'HELP'</i> etched onto the inside of the glass porthole in the airlock. She also finds here a bloodied earring she recognises from the picture of <i>Megan</i> she saw earlier.</p>

                After finding a misplaced pair of scissors, suspicious Howard confronts the pair, and threatens them with the submersion into a barrel of perchloric acid.
            </div>

            <p>After returning to the common room of the shelter, <i>Michelle</i> discusses her find with <i>Emmett</i> and shows him the purported picture of <i>Howard’s</i> daughter <i>Megan</i>, whom he recognises as a missing girl from his high school, <i>Brittany</i>. The pair realise that <i>Howard</i> abducted the girl and kept her locked in the underground bunker against her will, just as he now keeps them two. <i>Michelle</i>, who is a clothes designer, concocts a plan to fashion a makeshift <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazmat_suit" title="Biohazard suit a.k.a. Hazmat suit (Hazardous Materials suit) - a piece of personal protective equipment that consists of an impermeable whole-body garment worn as protection against hazardous materials, such as biological, chemical and radioactive agents">biohazard suit</a> from a discarded shower curtain, plastic bottle and duct tape, which one of them (as there is only enough material for one suit) would use to escape and call for help.</p>
            <p>Alas, <i>Howard</i> suspects that something is amiss, as he finds a misplaced pair of scissors, and confronts the pair, threatening them with the submersion into a barrel of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchloric_acid" title="Perchloric acid (HClO4) - dangerously corrosive mineral acid">perchloric acid</a>. Wanting to protect <i>Michelle</i>, <i>Emmett</i> fully accepts the blame, accompanying it with a made-up story to explain the displacement of the scissors, and apologises to <i>Howard</i>, who seemingly accepts his apology, but then, to <i>Michelle’s</i> utter horror, summarily executes <i>Emmett</i> with a single shot from the revolver to his head.</p>

                Despite the odds, Michelle defeats her captor and finally escapes from the underground shelter, but what she finds on the surface surpasses her worst nightmares.

            </blockquote>

            <p>While <i>Howard</i> acts as if nothing has happened and resumes his daily routine, distraught <i>Michelle</i> continues her work on the biohazard suit, but just as it is very nearly completed, she is again surprised by <i>Howard</i>. In an ensuing chase through the rooms of the shelter, <i>Michelle</i> tips over the barrel of acid on <i>Howard</i>, severely burning him and inadvertently starting a fire when acid burns through some electrical wires and causes a short circuit.</p>

However, little she suspects that her ordeal is far from over, because what she finds on the surface surpasses anything she could have ever dreamed of in her worst nightmares.</p>
