            <p><i>Z for Zachariah</i> is a post-apocalyptic science fiction drama film, which is loosely based on the novel of the same name by American novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._O'Brien_%28author%29" title="Robert Leslie Conly (pen name Robert C. O'Brien), American journalist and children's book author">Robert C. O'Brien</a>. The film, written by <i>Nissar Modi</i> and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Zobel" title="Craig Zobel, American film director">Craig Zobel</a>, was produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zik_Zak_Filmworks" title="Zik Zak Filmworks - a film production company based in Reykjavik, Iceland">Zik Zak Filmworks</a>, an Icelandic film production company. Shot mostly in New Zealand, standing in for the <i>Eastern United States</i>, the whole film features only 3 actors.</p>

            <p><i>Ann Burden</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie" title="Margot Elise Robbie, Australian actress">Margot Robbie</a>) is a young girl who lives alone on her family’s farmstead that is sheltered from radioactive contaminants by rocky hillsides of the valley it is located in, as well as favourable weather patterns. She survives by farming the land for vegetables, rearing chickens for eggs and catching fish in a small pond which also serves her as an abundant ground-fed water supply that is free from radioactive poisoning affecting other water sources throughout the region.</p>
            <p>Thinking that she is the only survivor of a nuclear war since the day when her family never returned back from a search expedition, <i>Ann</i> one day unexpectedly encounters a stranger clad in a radiation-proof suit. The fellow survivor, before <i>Ann</i> can warn him, undresses, takes a plunge in a radioactive stream, and immediately comes down with an acute radiation poisoning.</p>
            <p><i>Ann</i> takes the stranger into her farmhouse and nurses him back to health with help of anti-radiation serum she finds in the pushcart containing all man’s possessions. After the stranger comes to, he reveals himself as <i>John Loomis</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor" title="Chiwetelu Umeadi 'Chiwetel' Ejiofor">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a>), a highly-skilled engineer, who, protected by his radiation suit, has travelled a long way from a distant military bunker until he reached the safe haven of <i>Burden's</i> valley.</p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_cinema/cinema0076-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>Even before he fully recovers, <i>John</i> uses his expertise to advise <i>Ann</i> on how to manually pump petrol from the local petrol station (electricity is not working in this post-apocalyptic world), so that instead of menial hoeing, she can once more plough the field with the farm’s long-disused tractor, and helps her with many other things. Before too long, <i>Ann</i> accepts <i>John</i>, who slowly regains his strength, into her heart, and he gradually becomes an integral part of her rural life.</p>
            <p>Later, when <i>Ann</i> shows him an old petrol-powered electric generator, <i>John</i> speculates that power might be derived from the nearby waterfall by connecting the generator to a water-wheel fashioned from the <i>Burden</i> church’s wooden structure. <i>Ann</i> is uncomfortable with the proposal, citing her deep Christian beliefs and her father’s past involvement in the church as a preacher. Himself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism - the rejection of belief in the existence of God or other deities">atheist</a>, <i>John</i> decides not to push the matter on, at least for the time being.</p>
            <p>Before <i>Ann</i> and <i>John’s</i> cohabitation could develop to a fully-blown intimate relationship, suddenly, out of the nowhere, appears a third survivor, <i>Caleb</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pine" title="Christopher Whitelaw 'Chris' Pine, American actor">Chris Pine</a>.). Although <i>Ann</i> welcomes <i>Caleb</i> into the farmhouse, <i>John</i> is suspicious of the new arrival’s backstory and motives, and becomes quickly jealous of <i>Caleb</i>, who uses the faith he shares with <i>Ann</i> to help him win her heart.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the circumstances are now more favourable, <i>John</i> revives his water-generated-electricity idea and <i>Caleb</i> persuades <i>Ann</i> to go forward with the project (arguing that what is <i>inside</i> the church, i.e. <i>God</i>, is important, not the building itself). Soon, work commences on stripping down the church for the material.</p>
            <p>When the water-wheel is almost finished, the three hold a celebratory dinner, after which heavily-drunk <i>John</i> tells <i>Ann</i> he loves her, before passing out on the bed. Deeply disappointed and sexually starved <i>Ann</i> joins <i>Caleb</i> in the bathroom, where the two engage in intercourse.</p>

            <img class="image_right" src="images_cinema/cinema0076-3.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none; margin-bottom:12px;" />

            <p>Following the incident, the tension between <i>John</i> and <i>Caleb</i> deepens further. As the two men finish the water-wheel, moving it, and its wooden chute, into its place atop the waterfall, <i>Caleb</i>, encumbered by the bulky radiation suit he is wearing, slips twice during his rope-assisted climb up the slippery rock-side of the waterfall. <i>John</i> helps him first time, but when <i>Caleb</i> loses his balance for the second time, the two men silently lock glances, with <i>John</i> clutching the rope on whose other end <i>Caleb’s</i> life teeters on the cliff's edge.</p>

            <p>After <i>John</i> returns to the farmhouse, <i>Ann</i> apologises for her earlier transgression, but <i>John</i> waves this away, saying that <i>Caleb</i> decided to leave anyway, travelling further south in search of other settlements. <i>Ann</i> takes this news badly, running up the road after <i>Caleb</i>, but not finding him. The farmhouse’s electric lights and refrigeration are restored and <i>Ann</i> discovers that <i>John</i> has moved her beloved church organ, along with a couple of pews, into the barn, obviously realising that while he will likely never become a religious person, it would be perhaps wiser to at least tolerate <i>Ann’s</i> faith…</p>
