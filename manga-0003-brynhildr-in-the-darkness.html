                The storyline centres on high school student Ryouta Murakami (foreground) and his 'harem' of three female friends, possessing various, seemingly supernatural, abilities referred to as 'magic' (from left to right), Kana Tachibana, Neko Kuroha and Kazumi Schlierenzauer.
            </div>

            <p>The manga series, now running into its 140th issue, centres on high school student <i>Ryouta Murakami</i>, amateur astronomer, who, ten years prior, lost his best friend and childhood sweetheart <i>Kuroneko</i> in a freak accident, while looking for aliens on a local dam.</p>
            <p>In the present, <i>Ryouta</i>, now a top student in his class at the high school, still cannot forget about <i>Kuroneko</i> and is consumed by the feeling of guilt for her untimely death. He keeps the promise he made to her, and, as the only member of the local <i>Astronomy Club</i>, keeps looking up at the starry sky every night, searching for the aliens.</p>
            <p>One day, a seemingly impossible thing happens: a girl named <i>Neko Kuroha</i>, who is a spitting image of his childhood friend, appears as a transfer student in <i>Ryouta’s</i> class. <i>Neko</i> denies knowing <i>Ryouta</i>, but the striking resemblance between the late <i>Kuroneko</i> and present-day <i>Kuroha</i> remains always at the back of <i>Ryouta’s</i> mind.</p>
            <p>However, physical similarities aside, there are some striking differences between the two: <i>Kuroha</i> is seemingly able to predict the future and displays also other remarkable, seemingly supernatural abilities, such as unnatural strength. And, after she saves <i>Ryouta</i> from a certain death, by obliterating a huge boulder falling off the cliff, using mind-power alone, a split moment before it would smash him to a pulp, <i>Kuroha</i> reveals the true nature of her extraordinary abilities.</p>
            <p><i>Ryouta</i> finds out that <i>Kuroha</i> is one of the <i>‘witches’</i> – the term used to refer to her kind – individuals altered by a cybernetic implant or <i>‘harness’</i> located on their napes. The implant contains an alien parasite called <i>‘Drasil’</i> which, by means of the harness, connects with the host’s spine, giving the carrier various, seemingly supernatural, abilities referred to as <i>‘magic’</i>. <i>Kuroha’s</i> particular ability is destructive telekinesis that enables her to destroy any inorganic matter up to a distance of 12 metres (she used this power to disintegrate the boulder falling on <i>Ryouta</i>). Her special ability comes at a price however – every time she uses her <i>‘magic’</i> power, she loses part of her memories. <i>Kuroha</i> also informs <i>Ryouta</i> that she escaped from a top-secret alien-technology research facility, where unscrupulous scientists experiment on juvenile females like her (as young girls are, presumably, ideally suited to host the alien implants) with the aim to master the alien technology.</p>

                Hexenjagd (witch-hunt) is a small resistance group, which initially wants to destroy all the 'magic' users, a.k.a. 'witches'.
            </div>

            <p>In order to find out more, <i>Ryouta</i> secretly follows <i>Kuroha</i> to a remote house, where she is looking after her best friend, <i>Kana Tachibana</i>, who, as <i>Ryouta</i> learns later, escaped from the research facility along with <i>Kuroha</i>. <i>Kana’s</i> special ability enables her to foresee the near future, especially when someone is about to die (she was the one who warned <i>Kuroha</i> about <i>Ryouta’s</i> impending death in a landslide, thus saving his life). <i>Kana’s</i> entire body is paralysed (the result of a botched operation when she was fitted with her <i>‘harness’</i>) apart from her left hand, which she (by means of a small electronic device fitted with a keyboard, which generates synthetic voice) uses to communicate with the outside world.</p>
            <p>Girls, while at first suspicious of his motives (<i>Kana</i> initially suspects him of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyeurism" title="Voyeurism, the sexual practice of spying on people engaged in intimate behavior">voyeurism</a> and calls him a <i>“pervert”</i>), soon start to trust <i>Ryouta</i>, and reveal to him that every carrier of a <i>‘harness’</i> inevitably dies, unless they take a pill of <i>DR623G</i>, the so-called <i>‘Death Suppressant’</i> once a day.</p>
            <p><i>Ryouta</i> later learns, that the <i>‘witches’</i> are ranked according to their abilities and power of their <i>‘magic’</i>, ranging from the lowest rank B, via ranks A and AA, right up to the most powerful rank AAA. There are however, also several exceptional individuals with a rank S (<i>‘S’</i> for <i>‘Special’</i>), whose abilities are so extraordinary and who yield <i>‘magic’</i> so powerful, that the normal ranking system simply does not apply to them. S-ranked <i>‘magic’</i> users are also sometimes referred to as <i>Valkyries</i> (now the reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brynhildr" title="Brynhildr (a.k.a. Brunhild, Brunnhilde, Brynhild), a shieldmaiden and a valkyrie in Germanic mythology">Brynhildr</a>, one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie" title="Valkyries, female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live in Norse mythology">Valkyries</a>, in the series’ title starts making sense). Unbeknown to <i>Kuroha</i> (seemingly a lowly B-rank <i>‘magic’</i> user), she is in fact a S-ranked <i>‘magic’</i> user, though she is considered a failed experiment, because her power, however phenomenal it may be, is completely unpredictable and therefore cannot be controlled.</p>                        
            <p><i>Ryouta</i> offers <i>Kuroha</i> a safe haven at the rarely visited old observatory he frequents. <i>Kuroha</i> accepts, and becomes first new member of the <i>Astronomy Club</i>, later joined by her friend <i>Kana Tachibana</i>, C-rank <i>‘magic’</i> user, and three other <i>‘witches’</i>: <i>Kazumi Schlierenzauer</i>, a half-German girl, B+-rank <i>‘magic’</i> user whose special ability is computer hacking, <i>Kotori Takatori</i>, buxom bubbly girl who is a B-rank <i>‘magic’</i> user with a teleportation ability and <i>Hatsuna Wakabayashi</i>, A-rank <i>‘magic’</i> user who possesses the power of regeneration with the capability of restoring her body, or bodies of others, from otherwise fatal injuries.</p>

                Later in the story, Neko Kuroha finds her old diary, that helps her to fill-in some of the missing memories.

            <p>However, the bulk of the narrative concerns the quartet <i>Ryouta/Kuroha/Kazumi/Kana</i> with a primary focus on the odd love triangle that develops between the former three, with <i>Ryouta</i> fancying <i>Kuroha</i> and <i>Kuroha</i> liking him back, but, owing to the side-effect of her special abilities, having no recollection of it, therefore not returning his affection, making him think that she is not interested in him, and <i>Kazumi</i> relentlessly pursuing <i>Ryouta</i>, an attention that he finds somewhat disconcerting.</p>
            <p>Over the course of the series, <i>Ryouta</i> continuously tries to prove that his beloved childhood friend <i>Kuroneko</i> and the <i>‘magic’</i> user <i>Neko Kuroha</i> is one and the same person, struggles to protect her and the other <i>‘witches’</i> from being located and recaptured by <i>Chisato Ichijiku</i>, the chief professor in charge of the <i>‘magic’</i> users experiment, whose goal is to find and kill all the escapees – seeing them as failed specimens, all the </p>
