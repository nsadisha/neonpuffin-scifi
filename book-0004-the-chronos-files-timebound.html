            <p><i>Timebound</i> (originally self-published under the title <i>‘Time’s Twisted Arrow’</i>) is the first book from <i>‘The Chronos Files’</i> trilogy of novels written by American author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rysa_Walker" title="Rysa Walker (pen name), American author of young adult novels">Rysa Walker</a> (this is a pen name).</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel" title="Time travel - the theoretical concept of movement between different points in time">time travel</a> was discovered in the mid-22nd century by a team of researchers funded by the U.S. government, the <i>Chrono-Historical Research and Natural Observation Society</i> (<i>CHRONOS</i>), a society of historical researchers, was tasked with the challenge of creating a code of ethics for time travellers, and introducing effective safeguards against any sort of timeline manipulation.</p>
            
            <p>The solution was the genetic modification of historical researchers’ genome. Time travel would thus be restricted to a small number of responsible professionals, highly trained historians with this particular genetic encoding, who would travel to a specific point in the past and return directly to their original timeline, with the minimal impact on the visited time period.</p>

            <p><i>Kate Pierce-Keller</i>, a sixteen-year-old teenager, is one of these genetically altered individuals (or rather, she <i>inherited</i> her unique genetic make-up), however, she is completely unaware of her special <i>‘gift’</i>.</p>

            <p>Unaware that is, until her grandmother gives her a strange blue medallion adorned with the symbol of an hourglass (only she can see) and speaks of time travel. <i>Kate</i> initially assumes that the old woman’s mental faculties became compromised with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia" title="Dementia a.k.a. Senility - a broad category of brain diseases that cause a gradual decrease in cognitive abilities">senile dementia</a>. But soon it all becomes horrifyingly real when a murder in <i>Kate’s</i> past destroys the very foundations of her present-day life. Suddenly, that mysterious medallion is the only thing protecting <i>Kate</i> from literally blinking out of existence.</p>

            <p><i>Kate</i> learns that the killing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition" title="Chicago World’s Fair a.k.a World's Columbian Exposition - a World's Fair held in Chicago in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1492">Chicago World’s Fair</a> is a part of something much more large, much more profound and much more sinister, and that her genetic ability to time travel makes her the only one who can fix the future. Risking everything, <i>Kate</i> travels back in time to the year 1893 to try and prevent the murder that sets in motion the whole chain of events that follows.</p>

            <p>Changing the timeline comes with a personal cost however – if <i>Kate</i> succeeds, the boy she loves will no longer have any recollection of her existence. And, regardless of her motives, does <i>Kate</i> actually <i>have</i> the moral right to manipulate the fate of the entire human race?</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">&#x25C8;&nbsp; &#x25C8;&nbsp; &#x25C8;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><i>Rysa Walker’s Timebound</i> holds some potentially interesting premise, but a dull main protagonist with her lukewarm romance, as well as shaky storytelling clumsily interrupted by frequent info-dumps, drag the novel down, resulting in a somewhat underwhelming reading experience.</p>

            <p>The author since published also <i>Time’s Edge</i>, the second novel in <i>The Chronos Files</i> series, which follows <i>Kate’s</i> quest to save the Earth from the <i>Cyrist</i> conquest, and wrote two more novellas expanding <i>The Chronos Files</i> universe: <i>Time’s Echo</i> and <i>Time’s Mirror</i> (all published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Publishing" title="Skyscape - a young adult and children’s picture books imprint of Amazon Children’s Publishing, which itself is an imprint of Amazon Publishing">Skyscape</a>, a young adult imprint of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Publishing" title="Amazon Children’s Publishing - an imprint of Amazon Publishing">Amazon Children’s Publishing</a>). The third and last book of the series, <i>The Chronos Files #3 – Time’s Divide</i> is set to be published in October 2015.</p>
