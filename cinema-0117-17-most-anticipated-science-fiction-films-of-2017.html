The film is set in Berlin, a roiling city of immigrants where East crashes against West, forty years from present, and revolves around <i>Leo Beiler</i>, a mute bartender, who is searching for the love of his life who has mysteriously disappeared. Both the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie, influential English singer-songwriter and actor">David Bowie’s</a> talented son’s directorial debut <i>Moon</i> and his second science fiction film <i>Source Code</i> were excellent, so his latest creation too shouldn’t be a disappointment. The film, described by <i>Jones</i> as a <i>“spiritual sequel”</i> to his 2009 film <i>Moon</i>, should see a release sometime in 2017.</p>

It is unclear though, as yet, at what stage the movie is, or when it will be released.</p>

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alien 5</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in January 2015, when the <a href="cinema-0050-alien-5-xeno.html#slideshow" title="Concept Art for Alien 5 - Xeno by Geoffroy Thoorens">Concept Art</a> posted by film director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neill_Blomkamp" title="Neill Blomkamp, South African–Canadian film screenwriter, director and producer, known for his documentary-like style science fiction movies shot with a hand-held camera">Neill Blomkamp</a> on his Instagram profile raised speculations of the possibility of an <i>Alien</i> sequel being made under his direction, we got so excited, that we have written a special preview <a href="cinema-0050-alien-5-xeno.html" title="Alien 5: Xeno - a possible fifth film in the Alien franchise, directed by Neill Blomkamp">Alien: Xeno</a> to celebrate the occasion. The things cooled down a bit since, though. In October 2015 <i>Blomkamp</i> announced that the <i>Alien</i> project was put on hold, pending the outcome of the second film in the <i>Alien</i> prequel sequence, <i>Prometheus’s</i> follow-up <i>Alien: Covenant</i>. In April 2016, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver" title="Susan Alexandra 'Sigourney' Weaver, American actress who became famous for her role as a warrant officer Ellen Ripley in Alien film series">Sigourney Weaver</a> said she thought that, despite the hiatus, the proposed fifth <i>Alien</i> film would still go into production, following the completion of <i>Alien: Covenant</i>, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Sir Ridley Scott, influential English film director and producer, best known for his cult sci-fi films Blade Runner and Alien">Ridley Scott’s</a> insistence on the production order, reiterating that she and <i>Blomkamp</i> still hope to finish <i>Ripley’s</i> story in the fifth <i>Alien</i> film. However, in January 2017, when <i>Blomkamp</i> was asked by a fan via his Twitter account about the chances of the <i>Alien 5</i> happening, he responded by saying that they are <i>"slim"</i>.

The series, which is highly regarded for its detailed universe, thorough narrative, professional voice acting, character development and player’s in-game-choice effect on the overall experience, spawned several novels, a multitude of rather good comics (such as <a href="comic-0002-mass-effect-foundation.html" title="Mass Effect: Foundation - 13-issue comic book series written by Mac Walters, lead writer of the 'Mass Effect' video games">Mass Effect: Foundation</a>) and one anime film to date.

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;World War Z 2</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before the <i>World War Z</i> hit the cinemas, back in January 2012 film’s director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Forster" title="Marc Forster, German-born film screenwriter, director and producer">Marc Forster</a> and distributor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures Corporation - an American film studio based in Hollywood, California">Paramount Pictures</a> stated that <i>“they each view World War Z as a trilogy”</i>. Reaffirming this, immediately after the successful opening of <i>World War Z</i> in June 2013, <i>Paramount</i> announced that they were moving ahead with the sequel, further reporting in December 2013, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Bayona" title="Juan Antonio García 'J. A.' Bayona, Spanish film director, best known for directing horror and dark fantasy films">Juan Antonio Bayona</a> had been selected to direct the film. The commitment to quicken-up the production was further bolstered in May 2014 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight" title="Steven Knight, British film screenwriter and director">Steven Knight</a> was tasked with the writing of the screenplay, and in May 2015, when it was announced that the second <i>World War Z</i> film would be released on 9 June 2017. Unfortunately, the sequel then entered a developmental limbo, with <i>Paramount</i> announcing in January 2016 that film director <i>Bayona</i> is leaving the project due to other commitments, and further reporting in August 2016 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher" title="David Andrew Leo Fincher, American film and television series director and producer">David Fincher</a> had entered negotiations to be the film’s director and that the film was not yet in production.</p>

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Hole</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few of you will likely remember this sci-fi film directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Nelson_(director)" title="Gary Nelson, American television and film director">Gary Nelson</a>, produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company - multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate, headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California">Walt Disney Productions</a> and released in 1979 – the same year as <i>Ridley Scott’s</i> seminal science fiction masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)" title="Alien - a 1979 British-American science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott, first film in the Alien franchise">Alien</a>. And no wonder. There is nothing memorable about this dreadful excuse of a film. But it is only <i>‘after’</i> you compare these two films side-by-side when it becomes apparent just how revolutionary <i>Alien</i> truly was – and just how bad <i>‘The Black Hole’</i> really is. For example, take the humanoid android <i>Ash</i> from the <i>Alien</i>, and compare it to the vacuum-cleaner-resembling robot <i>V.I.N.CENT</i> from <i>The Black Hole</i> – do I need to continue? Plans to remake the film were toyed with at least since November 2009, when <i>Disney</i> revealed that it wants to re-imagine the movie for a new generation of cinemagoers and selected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kosinski" title="Joseph Kosinski, American television commercial and feature film director best known for his computer generated imagery">Joseph Kosinski</a> (<i>Tron: Legacy</i>) to direct the film. Later, in April 2013, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spaihts" title="Jon Spaihts, American film screenwriter">Jon Spaihts</a> (who wrote the original screenplay to <i>Alien’s</i> prequel, <i>Prometheus</i>), was confirmed as a script writer for the remake. Then, after a three-year hiatus, in 2016, it was announced that the film’s development was put on hold, because <i>Spaihts’s</i> script was considered by Disney <i>“too dark for a Disney movie”</i>, after which <i>Spaiths</i> was quoted to have commented on this thus: <i>“I loved that script, [But] it sits uneasily in Disney’s world as a dark epic, and Disney is a very colorful place.”</i>, before adding: <i>“I sure wrote a heck of a movie and was thrilled to do it. It was very faithful to the original but clever in all the ways that the first film was silly, I hope.”</i> The future of the project remains uncertain at the present.</p>

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurassic World 2</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already during the early discussions with the film’s director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Trevorrow" title="Colin T. Trevorrow, American film screenwriter and director">Colin Trevorrow</a> about the future of the <i>>Jurassic World</i> franchise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Allan Spielberg, influential American film screenwriter, director and producer">Steven Spielberg’s</a>, whose production company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin_Entertainment" title="Amblin Entertainment - an American film and television production company founded by film producers Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall">Amblin Entertainment</a> co-produced the movie, indicated that he was interested in having several, possibly two, more films made. Shortly after the film’s release in June 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pratt" title="Christopher Michael 'Chris' Pratt, American actor">Chris Pratt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Simpkins" title="Ty Keegan Simpkins, American actor">Ty Simpkins</a> confirmed that they are signed on for potential future films, but <i>Trevorrow</i> made clear that he would not be interested in directing another film in the series, reasoning that new directors could bring novel approaches and different qualities to future films (he said that it would be particularly interesting to see what new take on the <i>Jurassic World</i> could bring one of the Spanish horror film directors), however he stated that he will still be involved in the production in some way. In July 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios - an American film studio located in Universal City, California">Universal</a> announced that the sequel to <i>Jurassic World</i> is underway, that the previous film’s tandem of screenwriters <i>Colin Trevorrow</i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Connolly" title="Derek Connolly, American film screenwriter and producer">Derek Connolly</a> will be returning to write the script, that <i>Chris Pratt</i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Dallas_Howard" title="Bryce Dallas Howard, American film actress">Bryce Dallas Howard</a> will reprise their lead roles as <i>Owen Grady</i>, a Velociraptor expert and trainer at <i>Jurassic World</i>, and <i>Claire Dearing</i>, the <i>Jurassic World’s</i> operations manager, respectively, and that the film is scheduled for a 22 June 2018 release (with the UK release date brought forward to 7 June 2018). Hinting at the plot, <i>Trevorrow</i> said that the series <i>“isn’t always going to be limited to theme parks”</i>, further clarifying that the first <i>Jurassic World</i> sequel would not involve <i>“a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island”</i>, before adding: <i>“That’ll get old real fast.”</i>. In January 2016, it was reported that, in accordance with <i>Trevorrow’s</i> wishes, Spanish horror film director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Bayona" title="Juan Antonio García 'J. A.' Bayona, Spanish film director, best known for directing horror and dark fantasy films">Juan Antonio Bayona</a> could be a candidate to helm the film after he left the <i>World War Z</i> sequel (<a href="cinema-0117-17-most-anticipated-science-fiction-films-of-2017.html#worldwarz2" title="World War Z 2 - second film in the Paramount Pictures' post-apocalyptic zombie film series">see above</a>), and in April 2016, <i>Bayona</i> was indeed appointed as the film’s director. Later, it has been announced that the production will begin in Hawaii in February 2017, with Hawaii being used as a primary filming location and some shooting also taking place in UK studios. It was also confirmed that the third film in the <i>Jurassic World</i> series is already being planned.</p>

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avatar 2</h4>

            <h4>&#x25C8;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divergent Series: Ascendant</h4>
            <p style="margin-top:-5px; margin-bottom:20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally titled <i>‘The Divergent Series: Allegiant – Part 2’</i>, this, fourth and final instalment in <i>The Divergent Series</i> should have followed the latter half of the <i>Allegiant</i> novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Roth" title="Veronica Roth, American novelist known for her young adult science fiction novels">Veronica Roth</a>.

Then, in February 2016, <i>Lionsgate</i> announced that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schwentke" title="Robert Schwentke, German film director">Robert Schwentke</a> would not be returning to direct the final part, and three weeks later confirmed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Toland_Krieger" title="Lee Toland Krieger, American film screenwriter and director">Lee Toland Krieger</a> would replace him as the director of the film. Furthermore, in July 2016, it was reported that following the poor box office performance of <i>Allegiant</i>, <i>Lionsgate</i> was considering releasing <i>Ascendant</i> as a television pilot film that would wrap up the previous three films’ storylines and kick-start a <i>Divergent</i> spin-off television series. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shailene_Woodley" title="Shailene Diann Woodley, American actress, known for starring in the lead role of Beatrice 'Tris' Prior in The Divergent film series">Shailene Woodley</a> later said that the fourth film in the series wasn’t finalised yet, and that right now it’s all <i>“a limbo waiting game”</i>…</p>
