            <p style="margin-top: -3px;"><i>MidAmeriCon II’s ‘Star Wars Day’</i> will take place 40 years after the first <i>MidAmeriCon</i> hosted just the third public presentation about a then little known upcoming movie - <i>Star Wars</i>. Nine months before the May 1977 release, which changed the world of science fiction cinema forever, advertising publicity supervisor <i>Charles Lippincott</i> presented the members of the 1976’s <i>34th World Science Fiction Convention</i> with a slide show promoting <i>Star Wars</i> (or as it is known now, <i>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</i>). This was followed by a Q&A session where <i>Charles</i> was joined by actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hamill" title="Mark Richard Hamill, American actor best known for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars film series">Mark Hamill</a> and producer <i>Gary Kurtz</i>.</p>

            <br/><h4>Gaming</h4>

            <p style="margin-top: -3px;">Gaming is a big part of Fandom and will be well represented at <i>MidAmeriCon II</i>, that reserved no less than 465 square metres of gaming space which will be used for all-day gaming in the Exhibit Hall starting Wednesday afternoon and continuing through all opening hours in the <i>Bartle Hall Convention Center</i>, right up to Sunday.</p>

            <p>The gaming area will have a series of playtests available for sign up on the day. Several of these sessions will feature designers and developers showing off their new games, including limited sessions on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_Role-Playing_Game" title="The Firefly Role Playing Game - a science fiction role-playing game set in the universe of the Joss Whedon's television series Firefly">Firefly</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn_series#Role-playing_game" title="Mistborn - role-playing game based on the series of epic fantasy novels written by American author Brandon Sanderson">Mistborn</a> RPGs. Slots will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
