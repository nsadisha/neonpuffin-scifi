            <p style="margin-top: 25px">In the first novel of this two-book series of novels – <i>Proxima</i>, humans ventured to the planet of <i>Per Ardua</i>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri" title="Proxima Centauri - a red dwarf star and, at about 4.25 light-years distance, the nearest star to Earth other than the Sun">Proxima</a> system, where they discovered another of <i>‘Hatches’</i> – ancient alien artefacts of unknown origin that are portals allowing their users to step across vast distances of space and time in an instance – as if one was stepping into another room. The universe suddenly opened up to humankind. Now in <i>Ultima</i> the consequences of this new freedom make themselves felt. Humans discover that there are minds in the universe that are billions of years older than human race who have a plan for mankind – the plan that isn't necessarily in humanity's best interest.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px"><i>Ultima</i> opens on the other side of the <i>Per Arduan</i> portal, with two of the main characters of the novel, <i>Yuri Eden</i> and <i>Stef Kalinski</i>, having arrived in an alternative reality where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire - period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterised by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia, centred on the city of Rome, between c. 100 BC – c. 400 AD">Roman Empire</a> has never fallen. There they are met by <i>Centurion Quintus Fabius</i> aboard the interstellar vessel <i>Malleus Jesu</i> (from Latin: <i>'Hammer of Jesus'</i>), and learn that in this parallel universe the expansion of the <i>Roman Empire</i> has continued essentially unchallenged, kept in check only by the <i>Xin</i> (continuation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China#Imperial_China" title="Imperial China - The period of Chinese history from the beginning of Qin dynasty to the end of Qing dynasty">Chinese Empire</a>) in the east, and neutral <i>Brikanti</i> (descendants of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts" title="Celts - the peoples of Iron Age Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had cultural similarities, despite consisting of many disconnected tribes">Celts</a> living on the British Isles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings" title="Vikings (from Old Norse víkingr) - Norse seafarers, speaking the Old Norse language, who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of northern, central and eastern Europe from the late 8th to late 11th centuries">Vikings</a> of Scandinavia) in the north, and it is in the company of the latter, that <i>Ultima’s</i> other central characters – including <i>Yuri’s</i> daughter <i>Beth Eden Jones</i> and <i>Stef’s</i> twin sister <i>Penny</i> – find themselves caught.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 5px">They learn that the <i>Romans</i> and <i>Xin</i> are locked in an endless war, now, thanks to the <i>Hatches</i>, extended out into the solar system and beyond and super-charged by the stupendous power of the <i>Kernels</i>, the seemingly unlimited sources of energy left behind by the mysterious alien entities, which humans were only quick to turn into horrific weapons of mass destruction.</p>

            <p>Later, the disparate group of characters, amongst them <i>Yuri’s</i> daughter, <i>Beth</i>, and her daughter <i>Mardina</i>, sisters <i>Stef</i> and <i>Penny</i>, <i>Centurion Quintus Fabius</i> and a farming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence (AI) - Perceivable intelligence exhibited by machines, i.e. a state when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with human thought process, such as learning and problem solving">AI</a> unit <i>ColU</i>, all aboard <i>Malleus Jesu</i>, leaves Earth (or <i>Terra</i>, as the <i>Romans</i> call it) for the planet Mars in the footsteps of another AI – <i>Earthshine</i> (a unique one amongst the three <i>‘Core AIs’</i> – because he originated as an upload of several human minds – one of them being <i>Robert Braemann</i>, father of <i>Yuri Eden</i>, whose true surname was <i>Braemann</i>) that has managed to be transported there and clearly has plans of his own. It turns out that <i>Earthshine</i> has finally determined the origin of the mysterious creators of the <i>Kernels</i>. These <i>‘deep bugs’</i> or <i>‘The Dreamers’</i> as he came to call them, are essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile" title="Extremophile - an organism that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth">extremophilic</a> microorganisms that reside deep in the lithospheres of planets, spreading from one world to the other and eventually evolving into an enormous, vastly complex super-organism that transcends the universe, can live practically endlessly and therefore is also able to think over very long timescales. These <i>‘Dreamers’</i> learnt about the eventual cataclysmic end of the universe and devised a plan to sidestep it by using the actions of surface-dwelling life forms, primarily humans, by coaxing them to use the <i>Kernels</i>, which they conveniently provide, for building the <i>‘Hatches’</i> – thus creating new timelines <i>‘The Dreamers’</i> can live in. If, in some thus created alternative reality, users of the <i>Kernels</i> mismanage their enormous power and destroy themselves, or if some civilisation discovers and starts utilising the <i>Kernels</i> too late in its development for <i>Deep Bugs’</i> liking, the <i>‘Hatches’</i> are redirected to a new alternative history, more suited for the <i>Dreamers’</i> survival.</p> 

            <p><i>Earthshine</i>, realising the true purpose of the <i>‘Hatches’</i>, and not content with the notion of humans being mere puppets in a big scheme of the <i>Dreamers’</i> machinations, decides to send a ‘message’ to them in order to gain their attention. The intended <i>Earthshine’s</i> ‘message’ certainly couldn’t be overlooked as it involves ramming the dwarf planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" title="Ceres - A dwarf planet and the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter">Ceres</a> into Mars and in the process destroying one of the ancient <i>Dreamers’</i> colonies, existing deep within its crust.</p>

            <blockquote class="black" style="width: 340px; float: right">
                <span>
                    Ultima is a solid work of old-school science fiction, with the emphasis on ‘old-school’

            </blockquote>

            <p>When our group of travellers arrives on Mars to stop <i>Earthshine</i> from this, rather radical, action, they find out that it is already far too late. By now, <i>Ceres</i> is too far into its suicidal descend to be stopped. While <i>Stef</i> and <i>Beth’s</i> daughter <i>Mardina</i>, accompanied by <i>ColU</i>, evacuate with the <i>Roman</i> legionnaires under the command of <i>Titus Valerius</i> aboard <i>Malleus Jesu</i>, <i>Beth</i> with <i>Earthshine</i> enter the <i>Hatch</i> that appeared in the last moment before the impact, and step into the unknown. <i>Penny</i>, scientist to the very end, decides to stay behind to witness the impact. After <i>Beth</i> and <i>Earthshine</i> exit the <i>Hatch</i> at the other end, they realise that they ended up stranded on <i>Per Ardua</i>. In the meantime, <i>Mardina</i>, <i>ColU</i> and the <i>Romans</i> wind up on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire" title="Inca Empire - the largest empire in pre-Columbian America with its administrative, political and military centre in Cusco in modern-day Peru, existing between the early 13th century and the Spanish conquest in 1572">Incan</a> space outpost <i>Yupanquisuyu</i> in a version of reality where, following yet another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" title="Spacetime - a mathematical model that combines space and time into a single interwoven continuum">spacetime</a> shift triggered by the <i>Ceres’s</i> impact, the <i>Roman Empire</i> was defeated and the dominant world power are <i>Incas</i>.</p>

            <p>Obviously, with their underground colony on Mars utterly obliterated by the intense heat caused by the impact, the <i>Dreamers</i> ‘have got the message’, as <i>Per Ardua</i> <i>Beth</i> and <i>Earthshine</i> find themselves on, is <i>Per Ardua</i> of the far-distant future, billions of years after ‘their’ time, just before the end of the universe, where (or should it be when?) they are much later joined by the rest of the ‘family’. The <i>Dreamers</i> brought them here to realise that the lifespan of our world is finite, and to witness the very moment when the ‘bubble’ of our universe collides with the boundary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse" title="Multiverse - the hypothetical set of all possible universes, including the universe in which we live now">multiverse</a> and ‘pops’ out of existence…</p>

            <p>Like most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter_(author)" title="Stephen Baxter, British science fiction author">Stephen Baxter’s</a> novels, <i>Ultima</i> is a solid work of ‘old-school’ science fiction (with the emphasis here on <i>‘old-school’</i>), which is at the same time its biggest strength and weakness. In his book, the author clearly draws many inspirations from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke" title="Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist">A. C. Clarke’s</a> works (for instance his <i>‘Hatches’</i> are very obviously based on <i>Space Odyssey’s</i> <i>‘Monoliths’</i>), as well as from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Silverberg" title="Robert Silverberg, American author and editor, best known for his science fiction works">Robert Silverberg’s</a> alternative history of Roman Empire <i>‘Roma Eterna’</i>. Luckily, despite many similarities between Ultima and the former novels, <i>Baxter</i> stops short of plagiarism – although, and this must be said, he also doesn’t bring anything new to the genre. He also doesn’t make any attempt to explain how he proposes his minuscule <i>‘dreaming bugs in the rocks’</i> engineered the <i>Kernels</i> – highly sophisticated devices tapping into the energy of dying universe they use to create the space-time transcending <i>Hatches</i> and that trigger cosmic, reality-altering events, the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonbar_Hinge" title="Jonbar Hinge a.k.a. Jonbar Point - Science Fiction concept defining a crucial point of divergence between two outcomes, especially in time-travel stories">Jonbar Hinges</a>.</p>

            <p>There are also some shortcomings of writing style. For instance <i>ColU</i> (who throughout the series evolves from a simple purpose-built farming AI unit to a patient teacher, indispensable adviser and non-judgemental friend) insists, even in casual conversations, on calling everyone by their full names (e.g. <i>‘Yuri Eden’</i>, <i>‘Stef Kalinski’</i> instead of just <i>‘Yuri’</i>, <i>‘Stef’</i>) which, in sounding both awkwardly and unlikely, prevents the reader from full immersion in the story, and gives an impression that the author is here on a word count chase. But these are only minor points.</p>

            <p>If you are a casual reader of science fiction and like elaborate space operas, get this book – the chances are you will thoroughly enjoy it. If, on the other hand, you are a seasoned fan of the genre, like myself, and look for a sci-fi book that is not only entertaining (which is to say <i>Ultima</i> certainly does a good job at), but which also surprises you with something unexpected when you thought that you've already read and seen everything, you might want to try something more original instead, such as the recent <i>Ann Leckie's</i> <a href="book-0009-ancillary-justice.html" title="Read the review of 'Ancillary Justice', the first novel in Ann Leckie's ‘Imperial Radch’ space opera trilogy">Imperial Radch</a> space opera trilogy.</p>
