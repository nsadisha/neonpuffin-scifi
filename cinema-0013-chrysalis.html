            <p class="shift_paragraph_up">A deadly, highly-contagious infection laid waste to humanity 25 years ago. <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Penelope</i> are some of only a handful of survivors who are fighting daily for their lives with the remnants of the infected who turned into mindless, flesh-eating, zombie-like creatures. Despite their predicament, <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Penelope</i> feel strongly for each other and are determined to not only survive, but bring a baby into this bleak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction" title="Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> world, but <i>Penelope</i> keeps having miscarriages. The two struggle to make a meagre living by foraging for scraps of food amongst the ruins of what once were towns and cities, occasionally stumbling upon some of the infected.</p>

            <p>Then, one day they come across a woman called <i>Abira</i>, who claims that she could lead them to a sanctuary with a large group of uninfected people, that would offer them a more safe place to live in. Initially suspicious, <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Penelope</i> eventually admit <i>Abira</i> to their small group, only to see the attacks of the infected increasing exponentially. Pressed, <i>Abira</i> reveals that she was once bitten by one of the infected, but, miraculously, survived. As an unfortunate side-effect of this encounter, the infected can always somehow <i>‘sniff her out’</i> so that wherever she is, she pulls them to her, and anybody in her group, as a magnet. Though the infected do not harm her, anybody else who over the years accepted her company, has paid dearly - as soon <i>Joshua</i> and <i>Penelope</i> learn to their detriment.</p>

            <p><i>Chrysalis</i>, despite its low budget, presents some good acting and a few frights along with the interesting premise on which it fails to capitalise. If you are looking for a good post-apocalyptic horror film, watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Boyle" title="English film screenwriter, director and producer Danny Boyle">Danny Boyle’s</a> <i>28 Days Later</i> instead.</p>
