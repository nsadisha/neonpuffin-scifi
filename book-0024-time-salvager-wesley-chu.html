            <p style="margin-top:20px">Hot on the heels of his first trilogy of novels – <i>Tao</i>, Taiwanese writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Chu" title="Wesley Chu, American science fiction author of Taiwanese origin">Wesley Chu</a> comes with his second trilogy of books – <i>Time</i>, with the first novel in the series, <i>Time Salvager</i>, published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Books" title="Tor Books - the primary imprint of Tom Doherty Associates LLC publishing company, noted for its science fiction and fantasy titles">Tor Books</a>, paving the way for the new franchise. And franchise it’s going to be, as no sooner had the ink dried on the last page of the book, than the novel was optioned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures Corporation - an American film studio based in Hollywood, California">Paramount Studios</a> for a blockbuster treatment, with the well known American filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay" title="Michael Benjamin Bay, American filmmaker known for directing and producing big-budget action films">Michael Bay</a> (Armageddon, Transformers) attached to direct the big screen adaptation of <i>Chu’s</i> book.</p>
            <p><i>Time Salvager</i> is set in a dystopian future of the 26th century when Earth is a toxic, sparsely-populated wasteland with oceans and seas affected by seemingly unstoppable microbial plague, and when the technologically advanced humanity, ruled by all-powerful mega-corporations, such as <i>Valta</i>, that own mining rights to whole moons of the gas giants, has spread into the outer solar system, with the ailing Earth affected by the aforesaid environmental disaster left as one of the least desirable places to live.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:-10px;">Even though some technologies, such as space travel, advanced enormously in the intervening years, the human civilization, having gone through several devastating global wars, lost some vital knowledge, particularly that relating to energy generation, and now entered the era of slow but steady decline.</p>

            <br /> <!----- Important for layout ------>

            <p>With failing technology only a few are able to maintain and nobody to improve, the powers that be, and those tasked with delaying humanity’s descent, come to believe that the only thing that can turn the fortunes of mankind and pull back the society from the brink of disintegration is the newly discovered time travel, strictly controlled by <i>ChronoCom</i> – agency that regulates, and has sole monopoly on, travelling to the past.</p>
            <p><i>ChronoCom</i> employs <i>chronmen</i> – men and women recruited because of their unique psychological makeup for the most glamorous, but also most dangerous, job in the universe: to undertake missions to the past with the goal to recover the much sought-after sources of energy, lost technology and other valuable resources as well as priceless art treasures. In other words, <i>ChronoCom</i> basically oversees the task of cannibalising the past in order to prop up the ailing and technologically-challenged present.</p>
            <p>But there is a catch: each of these expeditions to the past, a.k.a. <i>‘salvages’</i>, creates a <i>‘ripple’</i> in the space-time continuum – and the bigger the ripple, the higher the chance that the whole time-stream is altered, with unforeseen, but likely highly undesirable, consequences for the present. Hence the <i>‘Time Laws’</i> a set of rules laid down by the <i>‘Mother of Time’ Grace Priestly</i>, genius pioneer of time-travel science and <i>High Scion</i> of the <i>Technology Isolationists</i> faction. The <i>Time Laws</i> stipulate that the time salvages be carried out only from carefully selected locations and points in time, where the salvaged objects face the inevitable, historically verifiable, destruction anyway.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Inherently, such points in space and time are extremely dangerous places – primarily locations of major natural calamities, industrial disasters and war conflicts, often accompanied by a high death toll. Beyond the requisitioned salvage, a <i>chronman</i> is strictly forbidden from interfering in the past that <i>‘is already written’</i> in any way, specifically from saving the victims of the above mentioned disasters, as that would inevitably alter the timeline, with unpredictable consequences for the present. For all the practical purposes, <i>‘these people are already dead’</i>, as every <i>chronman</i> keeps repeating themselves, although the constant exposure to such traumatic events eventually takes its toll on their psyche – which is the reason that most of the <i>chronmen</i> don’t survive beyond the first 10 years of service – either dying on the job or taking their own life.</p>
            <p>The storyline of <i>Time Salvager</i> centres on one of these <i>chronmen, James Griffin-Mars</i> and his <i>‘monitor’ Smitt</i>, and follows <i>James</i>, assisted by his handler, on his assorted missions that take him, amongst other places in space and time, on board of the spaceship <i>High Marker</i> – flagship of <i>Technology Isolationists</i>, where he meets 93-year-old <i>Grace Priestly</i>, legendary <i>‘Mother of Time’</i>; to the ancient China during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty" title="Han dynasty - the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC – 220 AD)">Han</a> dynasty where he is sent to capture a rogue chronman who is using future technology to present himself as a great martial arts master; and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsberg_Castle" title="Königsberg Castle - a castle in Königsberg, Germany (since 1946 Kaliningrad, Russia), that completely burnt down due to the bombing of the city by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War in 1944">Königsberg Castle</a> in Prussia , where he is tasked with salvaging the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Room" title="Amber Room (Russian: Yantarnaya Komnata) - a world-famous chamber decorated in amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors, constructed in the 18th century in Prussia for the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg, that disappeared during World War II">Amber Chamber</a>, before it disappeared in the smoke of war after the bombing of the castle by the Royal Air Force warplanes during the Second World War, when the entire castle burnt to the ground.</p>
            <p>We learn that the pair have to work-off the remaining 5 years of their service contract to buy themselves the well-deserved retirement on Jupiter’s moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)" title="Europa - the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, and the sixth-closest to the planet">Europa</a> (which is something of a paradise in this bleak, dystopian world). However, <i>James</i> who struggles with his bad conscience and heavy booze addiction (which his team mate <i>Smitt</i> tries to, rather futilely, rein in), is only well aware that he is reaching his breaking point and that his retirement at the end of those last five years is so distant that he will, in all likelihood, nosedive into the Jupiter's <i>‘eye’</i> (the traditional way to go for a suicidal <i>chronman</i>) before he will reach it.</p>
            <p>Then, as by a stroke of good fortune, <i>ChronoCom</i> offers <i>James</i> a lucrative salvage contract that, if successfully completed, would cut whole 4 years from his, and <i>Smitt’s</i>, remaining service. The job involves the retrieval of three items of unknown technology from the infamous <i>Nutris Platform</i> disaster in the Arctic Circle in the year 2097. That year itself, often referred to as the <i>‘Cliffside of Humanity’</i>, was significant, as it was the last year of the blessed era known as the <i>‘Final Golden Age’</i> – the brief period of innovation, international cooperation and world-wide peace, before the present era of <i>‘Great Decay’</i>, marked by environmental catastrophes, widespread famine, and devastating wars, began.</p>

                    Despite all the clichés, Chu delivers a gripping page turner with a solid and rich narrative, featuring several interesting, three-dimensional characters
                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The salvage has an added difficulty – the equipment has to be retrieved from three different locations on the platform, at least one of which is sited within a high-security area, and the whole job must be wrapped-up within a narrow, 4-hour window, between the time when the explosion was first reported and the moment when the platform sinks to the bottom of the ocean. <i>James</i>, conscious of the complications posed by the time restriction, arrives at the installation a couple of days earlier, hacks into the platform’s server, creates himself a new identity as a security guard, and proceeds to gather some intelligence in preparation for the salvage. Having completed his ‘homework’ and satisfied with the results, <i>James</i> decides to do something that is completely out of his character: he spends some quality time, and gets romantically involved, with <i>Elise Kim</i>, a biologist whom he happens upon while surveying the platform.</p>
            <p>When the day of the disaster comes, <i>James</i>, being an experienced Tier-1 <i>chronman</i>, handles the tricky assignment with relative ease and quickly retrieves the first two pieces of equipment. But then all goes south, when he, while salvaging the third and the last piece of equipment, gets trapped in the same room as <i>Elise</i>, just as the whole platform starts to sink to the bottom of the ocean. Haunted by the ghosts of the countless people he has left to die in the past, and the guilt he feels about being absent the day his little sister has gone missing in a turmoil that was their childhood, <i>James</i> finally breaks down and does something unthinkable, something that goes against all the years of training at <i>ChronoCom</i> and his common sense – unable to leave <i>Elise</i> to her certain (although historically correct) death either by drowning, or, worse still, by radioactive poisoning, he breaks the First and the most important <i>Time Law</i> of them all: he brings <i>Elise</i> back to the future with him, saving her life, but in the process instantaneously transforming himself from a privileged elitist to a traitor, outcast and fugitive.</p>
            <p>For better or for worse, <i>James</i> finally achieves what he was longing for all along: at last, he is free from the shackles of his contract. But being free comes at a price, as it means to be consigned to the inhospitable and dangerous wasteland of Earth. Luckily, the two fugitives soon find refuge with the <i>Elfreth</i> tribe - a group of semi-savage nomadic people who live within the ruins of once great cities, and, in order to beat the poisonous smog hanging above the ground and blocking all the sunlight, grow their greens on the rooftops of derelict skyscrapers. The simple but honest life the <i>Elfreth</i> lead inspires <i>Elise</i> to try and find a cure for the fatally ill oceans. Single-handedly and equipped with scrounged, sub-standard equipment, the scientist from the past embarks on this gargantuan undertaking that gives the tribe reason to look to the future with hope, while <i>James</i>, secretly tipped off by the insider information from his old teammate <i>Smitt</i>, jumps to-and-fro through time in search of equipment for <i>Elise’s</i> laboratory and supplies for the <i>Elfreth</i>, always staying a step ahead of <i>ChronoCom’s Levin Javier-Oberon, High Auditor of Earth</i>, and <i>Valta’s Securitate Kuo</i>, both hell-bent on bringing <i>James</i> to justice, even though for completely different reasons: <i>Levin</i> for violating the <i>Time Laws</i> and <i>Kuo</i> for interfering in <i>Valta</i> corporation’s nefarious plans.</p>
            <p><i>James, Smitt and Levin</i>, although standing on the opposite sides of the conflict, all wrestle with similar, increasingly complex ethical dilemmas, that make them question where their allegiances lie, and in the process come to realise that the ostensibly sovereign <i>ChronoCom</i> is in fact merely an obedient puppet in the hands of all-powerful inter-planetary mega-conglomerates, namely the corrupt <i>Valta</i> corporation.</p>

            <p>Although the <i>Time Salvager</i> doesn’t bring anything new, merely recycling the ages-old time-travelling story, and despite all the clichés that are generously peppered throughout the book, <i>Chu</i> knows his trade well, delivering a solid narrative with some interesting, three-dimensional characters, making the novel a gripping page turner. Highly recommended.</p>
            <p>The second book of the trilogy, <i>Time Siege</i>, was published by <i>Tor Books</i> in July 2016.</p>
