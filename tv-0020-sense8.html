            <p><i>Sense8</i> (a play on the word <i>sensate</i>, and the fact that there is <i>eight</i> main protagonists in the show) is a science fiction drama television series written, created and executive-produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis" title="The Wachowskis, the duo of American film screenwriters, directors and producers of Polish descent">Andy and Lana Wachowski</a> in cooperation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski" title="Joseph Michael Straczynski, American writer, screenwriter and producer of Polish descent">J.

                Sense8 centres on a loose group of eight mentally and emotionally linked people - ‘sensates’, who are (clockwise from top left): Will Gorski - a Chicago police officer, Riley Blue - an Icelandic DJ living in London, Capheus - a matatu driver in Nairobi, Kenya, Sun Bak - a South Korean businesswoman and martial arts expert …
            </div>

            <p>While all twelve episodes of the first season were written by the tandem of <i>Michael Straczynski</i> and <i>The Wachowskis</i>, who also directed most of the first season, several episodes were directed by their previous collaborators <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Tykwer" title="Tom Tykwer, German film screenwriter, director, producer and composer">Tom Tykwer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McTeigue" title="James McTeigue, Australian film director">James McTeigue</a> and <i>Dan Glass</i>.</p>
            <p>The series set out to explore subjects that its writers felt have, at least to date, not been sufficiently dealt with in the science fiction genre, such as identity, gender, sexuality, religion and politics.</p>
            <p>The plot of the show revolves around eight complete strangers living in totally different parts of the world and coming from vastly diverse walks of life, who suddenly become mentally and emotionally linked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy - the transmission of information from one person to another without using any known sensory channels (by thought alone)">telepathy</a>-like, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_possession" title="Possession - belief that gods, demons, spirits, extraterrestrials, animas or other persons can take control of a human body">possession</a>-like and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience" title="Out-of-body experience - a feeling of floating outside one's body and/or the feeling of perceiving one's physical body as if from a point outside one's body">out-of-body-experience</a>-like abilities they all seem to posses without any prior knowledge about having such powers. The eight <i>‘sensates’</i> (as they are referred to throughout the series), who are exactly the same age in the show, and were born on the same date – <i>8 August</i>, are as follow:</p>

                <p><i>Sun</i> lends her martial arts skills to <i>Capheus</i> to help him to defeat a local crime lord, or when <i>Will</i> makes use of <i>Lito’s</i> wooing expertise so that he can extract the information about the location of abducted <i>Riley</i> from a female member of staff in a secret research facility, which he enters through a security gate whose electronic lock he opens by his smartphone after <i>Nomi</i> loans him her hacking knack.</p>
                <p>To emphasise the international aspect of the story, filming of <i>Sense8</i> took place on several very diverse locations around the world, with the action taking place in nine cities: <i>London, Berlin, Reykjavík, Chicago, San Francisco, Seoul, Mexico City, Mumbai</i> and <i>Nairobi</i>, across eight countries and five continents.</p>
                <p>According to the <i>Wachowskis</i>, the origins of <i>Sense8</i> could be traced back to one late-night conversation several years ago, about how the technology unites and divides us at the same time. When the <i>Wachowskis</i> finally decided to develop the idea into a television series, they invited <i>Straczynski</i> to San Francisco (because of his extensive experiences with the format) to discuss the concept in more detail. They all agreed that if they were to do a TV series, they wanted to attempt to do something that had never been done before and <i>“change the vocabulary for television production”</i> in a similar way that they have changed the rulebook of filmmaking with their <i>The Matrix</i> trilogy of science fiction films.</p>

            </div>

            <div style="float:left; max-width:100%; margin-top:-11px;">

                <p>The trio became so excited about their concept, that they have decided to develop and executive-produce it on their own, rather than offering it to someone else. <i>The Wachowskis</i> had written three-hour-long script with the intention to pitch their show to potential buyers around L.A. According to <i>Straczynski</i>, at the very first meeting with prospective buyers, who happened to be <i>Netflix</i>, they talked to the executives about subjects which they wanted to address in the show, such as gender and identity, instead of pitching action, suspense or other more commercially viable aspects of the series, and, after the meeting was over, they worried that they might have put off the potential buyers. But, to their huge relief and pleasant surprise, before they had the chance to pitch the show to other film studios, <i>Netflix</i> called them back with an offer to buy the concept and produce the first season.</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, the character of <i>Nomi Marks</i>, a transgender woman central to the story, was written by <i>Lana Wachowski</i>, a trans-woman herself, who said that she partly used her own experiences when writing this role. <i>“It has some very intense, autobiographical scenes, and that was very difficult and surreal”</i> she said.</p>
                <p>In addition to <i>Michael Straczynski</i>, the <i>Wachowskis</i> invited also other long-term associates to collaborate on the project. Thus, besides actress <i>Doona Bae</i>, who is now a regular in <i>Wachowskis’</i> films, having starred in both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas_%28film%29" title="Cloud Atlas - a science fiction film written and directed by the Wachowskis">Cloud Atlas</a> and <a href="cinema-0025-jupiter-ascending.html" title="Jupiter Ascending - an American–Australian sci-fi blockbuster written, produced, and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski">Jupiter Ascending</a>, comic book and film storyboard artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Skroce" title="Steve Skroce, Canadian comic book and film storyboard artist of Croatian descent">Steve Skroce</a>, who has been working with the <i>Wachowskis</i> on <i>The Matrix</i> franchise, has created storyboards for the show, and <i>Tom Tykwer</i> with <i>Johnny Klimek</i>, who worked on the soundtrack for <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, composed the series’ music score which was orchestrated by another fellow <i>Cloud Atlas</i> collaborator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Pritsker" title="Gene Pritsker, Russian-born, New York-based guitarist, rapper, composer and record producer">Gene Pritsker</a>.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I have said in the beginning that the series was conceived by the <i>Wachowskis</i> with the aim to explore subjects that its writers felt other science fiction shows tend to ignore or skim through such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" title="LGBT - an acronym that stands for individuals of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexual orientation">LGBT</a> community and religious intolerance. This goal was undeniably achieved, although in the process the show ended up very nearly leaving out the science fiction element. Consequently, <i>Sense8</i> works very well as a drama but somewhat less so as a science fiction show.</p>

                </div>

                <p>As for the future of the series, <i>Straczynski</i> and <i>The Wachowskis</i> mapped out five-seasons-worth of stories for the show, including the series’ finale and the main cast of the show were signed for five seasons. <i>“We pitched it as a five-year story. We’ve mapped out five seasons of this thing, our actor deals are being made for five seasons – five or six depending on the breaks”</i> said <i>Straczynski</i>.</p>

                <p>On 8/8/2015 (see what they’ve done there?), <i>Netflix</i> announced that <i>Sense8</i> has been renewed for a second season.</p>
