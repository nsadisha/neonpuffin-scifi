            <p>Imagine the scenario: someone wants you dead. This person hates your guts so much that they decided that the world would be a much better place without you. If this person’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient" title="Intelligence Quotient (IQ) - a score in one of several standardised tests designed to assess human intelligence">IQ</a> is at least equal to that of an average badger, <i>you are as good as dead</i>.</p>

            <img class="image_left" src="images_tv/tv0024-2.jpg" alt="" title="" style="border:none;" />

            <p>But surely, I can hear you say, the killer won’t get away with it. Given the highly-advanced forensic techniques (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling" title="DNA profiling a.k.a. DNA fingerprinting - a forensic technique used to identify individuals by characteristics of their DNA">DNA profiling</a>) and technological capabilities (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system" title="Facial Recognition System - a computer application for automatically identifying a person from a digital image or a video recording">facial recognition</a> systems) available to the police today, the crime will be investigated, the perpetrator promptly caught, convicted and punished with the full force of the law, which means that the offender will be subject to a lengthy prison sentence, or, if the deed was committed in a country that practices <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital Punishment a.k.a. Death Penalty or Execution - punishment by death for criminals who committed particularly brutal crimes, such as murder or rape">capital punishment</a>, the murderer will be put to death.</p>
            <p>However, that is completely beyond the point. Crime is crime, and punishment is punishment. Punishing the killer may do just that (i.e. punish them), may prevent them committing more crimes in the future, it may even serve as a deterrent to other would-be offenders. But it is not going to change anything for you, as, notwithstanding the consequences, the perpetrator has achieved their objective – you are dead and nothing will bring you back. Do you see my point?</p>
            <p>But what if there was a way to pinpoint the place and time of every serious crime about to happen and then send the law enforcement officers to catch the would-be-perpetrator <i>before</i> the crime is committed?</p>
            <p>This precisely is the premise of the 2002 science fiction thriller film <i>Minority Report</i> directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Allan Spielberg, influential American screenwriter, director and producer">Steven Spielberg</a> and loosely based on the short story of the same name by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" title="Philip Kindred Dick, American novelist and short story writer, known mainly for his science fiction works">Philip K. Dick</a>. The storyline of the film follows members of the Washington, D.C.’s <i>Pre-Crime Unit</i> as they devise and put into practice the ultimate crime-prevention scheme: Precognition of serious crimes. The method is based on premonitions of three <i>‘Precogs’</i> – <i>Dash, Arthur</i> and <i>Agatha</i> – siblings with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal" title="Paranormal Phenomena - events whose existence lies beyond normal experience or scientific explanation">paranormal</a> abilities who <i>‘pre-visualise’</i> crimes before they are actually committed.</p>

            <p>The upcoming science fiction crime television drama <i>Minority Report</i> is set in Washington, D.C. in the year 2065 (eleven years after the events of the film). After the <i>Crime Precognition</i> technique was compromised and its results put into doubt, the <i>Pre-Crime Unit</i> was dismantled in 2054 and all would-be-offenders currently in custody were pardoned (although many were placed under surveillance in case of their would-be-crimes actually happening). Now, in 2065, crime-solving is different, and law enforcement officers rely more on sophisticated forensic techniques and reliable technology than on the questionable instincts and ambiguous visions of the <i>Precogs</i>.</p>
            <p>However, one of the <i>Precogs</i>, <i>Dash</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_Sands" title="Stark Bunker Sands, American film, television and stage actor">Stark Sands</a>), driven by his terrifying, but fragmented visions of the future, has returned in secret to help a shrewd, though a bit brash, police detective <i>Lara Vega</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meagan_Good" title="Meagan Monique Good, American actress">Meagan Good</a>) attempt to stop the murders that he sees in his premonitions.</p>
            <p>As <i>Lara</i> and <i>Dash</i> fight together future crime, they are forced to forge an uneasy alliance with <i>Dash’s</i> ambitious and manipulative twin brother, <i>Arthur</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Zano" title="Nick Zano, American film and television actor">Nick Zano</a>), who uses his extraordinary ability to advance his own self-interest, and elude others who will stop at nothing to exploit their precognitive abilities. Further complicating matters are <i>Lara’s</i> newly appointed boss <i>Will Blake</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmer_Valderrama" title="Wilmer Eduardo Valderrama, American film and television actor">Wilmer Valderrama</a>) and <i>Dash</i> and <i>Arthur’s</i> reclusive, yet ingenious, foster sister, <i>Agatha</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Regan" title="Laura Regan, Canadian film and television actress">Laura Regan</a>), who seemingly wants only the best for her two brothers, but may be playing a longer game than anybody suspects.</p>
