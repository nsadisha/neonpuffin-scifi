                One of the rather impressive virtual-reality-trials CGI scenes The Divergent Series has become known for.
            </div>

            <p>At the end of the first part of the trilogy, <a href="cinema-0002-divergent.html" title="Divergent, first part of 'The Divergent Series'">Divergent</a>, we saw <i>Tris</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shailene_Woodley" title="Shailene Diann Woodley, American actress">Shailene Woodley</a>), <i>Four</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_James" title="Theodore Peter James Kinnaird Taptiklis a.k.a. 'Theo' James, English actor">Theo James</a>), <i>Peter</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Teller" title="Miles Alexander Teller, American actor">Miles Teller</a>) and <i>Tris’s</i> brother <i>Caleb</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Elgort" title="Ansel Elgort, American actor">Ansel Elgort</a>) escaping from the metropolis aboard a train into the territory behind the protective fence surrounding the city.</p>
            <p>As the four youths are escaping, <i>Jeanine</i>, the leader of the <i>Erudite</i> and the self-appointed dictator of the metropolis, comes into possession of a mysterious box, marked with the symbols of all the factions, apparently containing a message from the city’s founders and the instructions on how to end the <i>Divergence</i> problem. There is a small snag however: the box can be opened only by a <i>Divergent</i>. <i>Jeanine</i> therefore sends out one of the leaders of <i>Dauntless</i>, <i>Eric</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Courtney" title="Jai Stephen Courtney, Australian actor">Jai Courtney</a>) with the task to find and capture all the <i>Divergent</i>.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, the quartet of escapees finds a temporary refuge within <i>Amity</i> community, but they are soon betrayed by <i>Peter</i> and sniffed out by <i>Eric</i> and his troops, who scan all the citizens for signs of <i>Divergence</i>. In the ensuing shoot-out, <i>Tris</i>, <i>Four</i> and <i>Caleb</i> manage to escape aboard yet another train, this time heading for <i>Factionless</i> territory. During the scuffle with <i>Factionless</i> on the train, <i>Four</i> reveals that his true name is <i>Tobias Eaton</i>, causing the <i>Factionless</i> to stop fighting and revealing that they have been already searching for him.</p>

                Tobias ‘Four’ Eaton, Beatrice ‘Tris’ Prior and Caleb Prior are running from the ruthless leader of Dauntless, Eric.
            </div>

            <p>It transpires that <i>Tobias Eaton</i> a.k.a. <i>Four</i> is the son of <i>Factionless’</i> leader, <i>Evelyn Johnson-Eaton</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Watts" title="Naomi Ellen Watts, British actress">Naomi Watts</a>). <i>Four, Tris</i> and <i>Caleb</i> are given safe passage into the heart of <i>Factionless</i> territory. <i>Evelyn</i> suggests that <i>Dauntless</i> and Factionless should join their forces in order to topple the dictatorship of <i>the Erudite</i>. <i>Four</i> is at first reluctant, suspecting that his mother has some ulterior motives, but later, under pressure of circumstances, agrees. <i>Tris</i> and <i>Four</i> leave <i>Factionless</i> headquarters for the territory of the <i>Candor</i> to meet up with the remaining <i>Dauntless</i>, but <i>Caleb</i> refuses to continue with them and decides to go in a different direction.</p>
            <p>Soon after the couple arrive into <i>Candor</i> territory, this is attacked by a faction of the <i>Dauntless</i> loyal to <i>Jeanine</i> and led by <i>Eric</i>. <i>Tris</i> and <i>Uriah</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiynan_Lonsdale" title="Keiynan Lonsdale, Australian actor">Keiynan Lonsdale</a>), who turns out to be also <i>Divergent</i>, are captured by <i>Eric</i> who tests <i>Tris</i> for <i>Divergence</i>, finding that she is 100% <i>Divergent</i>, making her the perfect subject to open the mysterious box. Fortunately, before <i>Eric</i> can escort <i>Tris</i> away, <i>Four</i> and the <i>Candor</i> come to the rescue. <i>Eric</i> is taken into custody where <i>Four</i> executes him.</p>
            <p>Back in <i>Erudite</i> H.Q., <i>Jeanine</i>, who becomes increasingly frustrated that none of the <i>Divergent</i> she captured have survived the attempt to open the box, is approached by <i>Peter</i> who suggests that the best way to get <i>Tris</i> to surrender is to play on her compassion. <i>Jeanine</i> likes the idea.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile in <i>Factionless</i> hideout, in a scene that could be straight out of a 1950s B-movie, three hapless folks, affected by the mind-controlling serum activated by <i>Jeanine</i>, stand on a high ledge, chanting: <i>“Tris Prior must turn herself in – or more deaths will follow”</i>, while stepping closer and closer towards the edge. <i>Tris</i> and <i>Tori</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Q" title="Margaret Denise Quigley a.k.a. 'Maggie Q', American actress of Vietnamese descent">Maggie Q</a>) climb up as fast as they can, and stop two of the three would-be victims from jumping, but one unfortunate girl plunges over the edge to her death. Overcome by guilt, and fearing more innocent victims, <i>Tris</i> turns herself in.</p>

                Jeanine uses the strict faction system as a means to control the population of the city.
            </div>

            <p>At <i>Erudite</i> facility, <i>Jeanine</i> subjects <i>Tris</i> to each of the several virtual reality tests (one per faction) that are required to open the box. Only one test now remains, but, as <i>Tris</i> is almost killed in the process, <i>Jeanine</i> reluctantly interrupts the simulation, allowing <i>Tris</i> to recuperate in a cell with her brother <i>Caleb</i>, who is now working for <i>Jeanine</i>. Meanwhile, <i>Four</i>, who attempts to rescue <i>Tris</i>, is also captured and held captive within the premises, where <i>Peter</i> now works as a guard assigned to <i>Tris</i>. After while, the tests are resumed, but before they can be completed, <i>Tris’s</i> vital signs drop and she appears to flatline. Her body is disconnected from the simulator and wheeled over to <i>Four’s</i> cell for the last farewell.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Unexpectedly, <i>Tris</i> awakens, and <i>Peter</i> assists <i>Four</i> in overpowering the guards, revealing that he is on their side, and that it was him who gave <i>Tris</i> an injection making her appear dead. <i>Peter</i> then goes to the control room and changes the security parameters, allowing <i>Tris</i> and <i>Four</i> access to the simulation room.</p>
            <p><i>Tris</i>, this time on her own will, passes the final test, the box opens, and, much to the chagrin of <i>Jeanine</i>, the message stored inside informs everyone that the entire walled city was an experiment whose goal was not the eradication, but emergence and propagation of the <i>Divergent</i>. <i>Jeanine</i>, realising that this revelation will undermine her grip on power, orders the box buried and <i>Tris</i> with <i>Four</i> executed.</p>
            <p>Before this can happen though, the combined <i>Factionless</i> / <i>Dauntless</i> army storms the facility and liberates them. The message from the box is broadcast to the masses, eager to explore the world beyond the wall, who hail <i>Tris</i> as a hero…</p>
            <p>Those who came to see the film in the expectation that it will bring something breathtakingly novel, original or exceptional, will be bitterly disappointed. As far as the storyline goes, <i>Insurgent</i> offers only another dose of the same mediocrity <i>The Divergent Series</i> has become synonymous with.</p>

            <br class="clear" /> <!----- Important for layout ------>

            <p style="margin-top: 0px">On the plus side, the movie concentrates less on the (ridiculously unconvincing) faction system of the <i>Divergent</i> universe that divides society into five groups based on personality traits (that was the major drawback of the first film) and more on the actual storyline and action scenes, which, mainly in their now trademark ‘virtual reality trials’ form, deliver on their promise. The film is not that bad as some would have you believe, but ultimately it can be recommended only to the die-hard fans of the series or to those under twelve.</p>

            <p>In what was obviously a purely business decision, the third, and last, instalment of <i>The Divergent Series</i> is being broken into two parts. Ever since the last <i>Harry Potter film</i>, <i>‘Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows’</i>, film studios have made a silly habit of splitting up the final film in a series, especially in young-adult franchises, into two parts. So now it all makes perfect sense: the next film will be <i>‘the first part of the third part’</i> of <i>The Divergent Series</i>. Mind boggles.</p>
            <p><i>The Divergent Series: Allegiant – Part 1</i>, also directed by <i>Robert Schwentke</i>, is scheduled to be released on 18 March 2016.</p>
