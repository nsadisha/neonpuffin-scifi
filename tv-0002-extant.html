                Despite this being clearly impossible, Molly Woods, an ISEA astronaut aboard the space station Seraphim, is visited in space by her deceased boyfriend Marcus.

            <p>Each summer, all the major television networks receive about 500 brief <i>‘elevator’</i> pitches for proposed new shows from writers and producers. By autumn, each network requests scripts for about 70 pitches and, in the January of the following year, orders about 20 <i>‘pilot’</i> episodes. A <i>‘pilot’</i> is a standalone episode of a proposed television series that writers and producers use to try and sell the show to a television network. Television networks use these <i>‘pilots’</i> to evaluate whether a proposed entertaining concept can be successfully realised. After seeing this sample of the final product, executives (i.e. <i>‘the suits’</i>) of the individual networks decide whether the financial investment is justified (as the television industry is, after all, only a business like any other) and whether to invest into a complete season of the television series.</p>
            <p>The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS Broadcasting, Inc., American commercial broadcast television network">CBS</a> placed a 13-episode straight-to-series order for the science fiction television drama series <i>Extant</i>, bypassing the traditional pilot stage, says something about the quality of the series, about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Allan Spielberg, American film director, screenwriter and producer">Steven Spielberg</a> being one of the executive producers, or, most likely about both. With the master filmmaker himself at the helm of the project, and <i>Halle Berry</i> accepting the lead role, who am I to question their decision? Expectations were high and <i>Extant - Season 1</i> certainly delivers on those high expectations. While not entirely original and generously borrowing from numerous previous sci-fi works, <i>Halle Berry’s</i> strong lead and professional execution throughout guarantees high quality entertainment for the whole family.</p>

                Molly could not only see, talk and touch her, now long time dead, former lover, but she somehow becomes pregnant in the process.
            </div>

            <p>Returning from a 13-month solo mission aboard the space station <i>‘Seraphim’</i>, astronaut of the <i>International Space Exploration Agency</i> (<i>ISEA</i>) <i>Molly Woods</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry" title="Halle Maria Berry, American actress">Halle Berry</a>) tries to reconnect with her husband <i>John</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Vi%C5%A1nji%C4%87" title="Goran Visnjic, Croatian-born, American-based actor">Goran Visnjic</a>) and their <i>‘son’ Ethan</i>, a highly-advanced android with self-learning AI, developed by <i>John</i> and <i>‘adopted’</i> by the <i>Woods</i> family, when <i>Molly</i> failed to conceive after experiencing a miscarriage in a car crash. After her return, <i>Molly</i> is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, despite being all that time in space completely alone. When she tries to make some sense of this, she recalls a strange, ghost-like encounter during the mission in which she met, talked to, and even physically interacted with her former boyfriend <i>Marcus</i>, despite this being utterly impossible, as <i>Marcus</i> died some time previously in the same car accident in which <i>Molly</i> lost her child.</p>
            <p>After she is contacted by <i>Harmon Kryger</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Beyer" title="Brad Beyer, American actor">Brad Beyer</a>), a fellow astronaut who supposedly committed suicide after having similar experience in space, and who claims to know what happened during her mission, and after some unhealthy interest in her pregnancy from <i>Alan Sparks</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_O%27Neill_%28actor%29" title="Michael O'Neill, American actor">Michael O'Neill</a>), director of <i>ISEA</i>, <i>Molly</i> starts to suspect that while in space, <i>ISEA</i> experimented on her without her consent, and that her pregnancy is a direct consequence of these experiments. And when <i>Sparks</i> offers to take her to a remote <i>ISEA</i> facility for some tests relating to her pregnancy, alarmed <i>Molly</i> starts to smell a rat, and, further disquieted by a warning call from <i>Sam Barton</i>, a physician employed by <i>ISEA</i> and her friend, freaks out and escapes from <i>Sparks’s</i> car.</p>

               Molly’s husband John developed Ethan, a highly-advanced android with self-learning AI, which is ‘adopted’ by the Woods family after Molly failed to conceive.
            </div>

            <p><i>John</i>, who before struggled to buy her conspiracy theories, now believes <i>Molly</i>, they hastily pack a few things and, along with <i>Ethan</i>, escape to <i>Molly's</i> father's house, located on a remote island, hoping they could find a safe refuge there. Alas, <i>Molly’s</i> sense of security proves to be an illusion – it doesn’t take too long and <i>Sparks’s</i> men find her even here. They ambush her while she is alone, looking for <i>Ethan</i> who got missing after some silly argument with <i>Molly's</i> father, tranquillise her and take her to an offshore surgical facility where her foetus is removed.</p>
            <p>When <i>Molly</i> comes round, she is back ashore, and she is no longer pregnant. What is more, thanks to advanced surgical technologies available in the future, there are no scars on her abdomen. Distraught <i>Molly</i> now really struggles to convince <i>John</i>, and anybody else, that she really was pregnant, when she clearly no longer is! <i>Dr. Barton</i>, who previously performed <i>Molly’s</i> pregnancy test, now (after being blackmailed by <i>Sparks</i>) claims she never performed any tests on her and suggests that <i>Molly</i> is suffering from delusions.</p>

                Hideki Yasumoto, enigmatic owner of the Yasumoto Corporation, came to believe that ‘Offspring’ holds the key to human immortality. 
            </div>

            <p>Meanwhile, it becomes apparent that <i>Hideki Yasumoto</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroyuki_Sanada" title="Hiroyuki Sanada (born Hiroyuki Shimosawa), Japanese actor">Hiroyuki Sanada</a>), enigmatic owner of the <i>Yasumoto Corporation</i>, who provided <i>John</i> with funding to continue with his <i>‘Humanichs’</i> android project, is involved with <i>ISEA</i> director <i>Alan Sparks</i>, and it was he who ordered removal of <i>Molly’s</i> foetus that he calls <i>‘Offspring’</i> and which he intends to use for his own dubious plans.</p>

            <p>Despite all the odds being against her, determined <i>Molly</i> sets out on a journey to find out what really happened that day on <i>Seraphim</i> space station and what became of her baby, and in doing so, she sets in motion a chain of events with unforeseen consequences not only for her and her family, but potentially for the whole humanity.</p>
            <p><i>Extant</i> was renewed for a second season, returning in summer 2015.</p>
