            <p>Using all-new powers and abilities, <i>Billie</i> will retrieve ancient artefacts in a thrilling bank-heist mission, infiltrate underground fight clubs and square off against the <i>Sisters of the Oracular Order</i>, the immortal <i>Envisioned</i> and the <i>Outsider</i>-worshiping <i>Eyeless Gang</i>. Alongside these new enemies, she will face also some familiar foes – such as more advanced version of <i>Clockwork Soldiers</i>.</p>

As previously, you will be able pull off your assassinations in whatever way you prefer – whether sneaking in the shadows and quietly killing the unwary target, or using a brute force and savagely dispatching your foes out in the open.</p>
            <p>Throughout her journey, <i>Billie</i> will uncover some of the secrets surrounding the <i>Outsider</i> – an enigmatic 4,000-year-old entity which has been responsible for the Empire’s most dishonourable moments. And when she will be finally facing the mysterious, god-like <i>Outsider</i> himself, <i>Billie</i> will be confronted with difficult choices that, for better or worse, will change the world around her forever.</p>
