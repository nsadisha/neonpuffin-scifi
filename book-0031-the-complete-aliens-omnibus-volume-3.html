            <p style="margin-top:20px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Books" title="Titan Publishing Group - an independently owned British company, publishing books, graphic novels and comics">Titan Books</a> have published the third instalment in their planned 7-book <i>‘The Complete Aliens Omnibus’</i> series, with the Volume 3 collecting two original stories from the <i>Aliens</i> expanded universe: <i>Rogue</i> by <i>Sandy Schofield</i> and <i>Labyrinth</i> by <i>S.D. Perry</i>.</p>

            <p class="largest" style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Rogue by Sandy Schofield</b></p>  

            <p><i>Sandy Schofield</i> is not an actual person, but rather a pen name of an American, husband-wife writing team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Wesley_Smith" title="Dean Wesley Smith, American science fiction author, known primarily for his Star Trek novels and other film novelizations">Dean Wesley Smith</a> & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristine_Kathryn_Rusch" title="Kristine Kathryn Rusch, American writer who writes under various pseudonyms in multiple genres, including science fiction, fantasy, mystery and romance">Kristine Kathryn Rusch</a>, who in the past collaborated on many stories from other expanded universes, particularly those of <i>Star Trek</i> (including <i>Deep Space Nine, Voyager, The Next Generation</i> and <i>Enterprise</i>) and <i>X-Men</i>. This time, in their novel Rogue, the pair delves deep into the dark <i>Aliens</i> universe, with the story set some time after the <i>Alien</i> invasion of Earth.</p>
            <p>The plot of the book centres on <i>Captain Joyce Palmer</i>, who arrives at the asteroid <i>Charon</i>, former penal colony and now home to a top-secret research facility overseen by <i>Profesor Ernst Kleist</i>, who runs the place as his own personal, twisted playground. Deep within the extensive maze of underground tunnels, dug many years ago by hundreds of convicts whose time-bleached bones still adorn the countless niches of the catacombs, alongside human settlers, thrives also a huge <i>Xenomorph</i> hive, with its queen busy laying dozens of eggs that will soon hatch and spawn a small army of parasitic <i>facehuggers</i> eager to seek out their hapless, unwitting hosts.</p>
            <p><i>Professor Kleist</i>, whose speciality is to make inconvenient people disappear – ending up as breeding material for his <i>Alien</i> hatchery, is an egomaniac for whom his work means everything and who perceives the human colonists as mere pawns in his grandiose plan to produce a docile strain of <i>Aliens</i>, thus achieving fame and immortality.</p>
            <p>When <i>Captain Palmer</i> finally sees through <i>Kleist’s</i> machinations, she, accompanied by a small platoon of combat-hardened Colonial Marines led by <i>Sergeant Green</i> and a few members of recently-formed resistance, tries to stop the insane professor. But are they already too late as he unleashes his most terrible creation yet – the <i>Rogue</i>?</p>

            <p class="largest" style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:0px;"><b>Labyrinth by Stephani Danelle ‘S.D.’ Perry</b></p> 

            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._D._Perry" title="Stephani Danelle Perry, American novelist known primarily for her tie-in novels based on fantasy, science-fiction and horror film and television series franchises">S.D. Perry</a> is an American novelist who primarily writes tie-in novels based on works in the science-fiction, fantasy and horror genres, who has to date written numerous <i>Resident Evil</i> novels (based on both original survival-horror video game series and its film adaptations, both tie-ins and original stories) as well as four <i>Alien</i>, two <i>Aliens vs. Predator</i> and eight <i>Star Trek</i> (The Original Series and <i>Deep Space Nine</i>) extended universe titles. When not working on official novelisations of various blockbusters, <i>Perry</i> also writes original horror stories.</p>
            <p>The story of the <i>Labyrinth</i> takes place on the space station <i>Innominata</i>, where the notorious <i>Colonel Dr Paul Church</i> is having some success in exploiting the <i>Aliens’</i> ability to communicate telepathically. <i>Dr Church</i> built on the station a complex maze of tunnels in which he is subjecting his <i>Xenomorph</i> subjects to various tests. <i>Colonel Dr Anthony Crespi</i> is sent by his superiors to <i>Innominata</i>, ostensibly to assist <i>Dr Church</i> in his research – replacing doctor’s late assistant <i>Dr. Lennox</i> who suffered a fatal heart attack, but his real mission is to investigate <i>Church</i> and his activities, among the growing concerns about the ethical aspect of doctor’s work. <i>Crespi</i> arrives at <i>Innominata</i> accompanied by a small contingent of <i>Colonial Marines</i>, including <i>Lieutenant Sharon McGuinness</i>, who too harbours an ulterior motive for visiting the station – she was <i>Lennox’s</i> fiancée and suspects that his death was the result of some foul play. With the men on <i>Innominata</i> disappearing one by one, <i>Crespi</i> and <i>McGuinness</i> in the end find their way to the very heart of the <i>Church’s</i> labyrinth, where they discover a hidden area with a secret laboratory, finally uncovering the horrific truth about the real nature of doctor’s experiments – he has been attempting to splice human and <i>Xenomorph</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) - a molecule carrying the genetic instructions used in the growth and development of all known living organisms">DNA</a>, thus creating grotesque <i>Alien</i>-human hybrids. But with <i>Church</i> prepared to do anything to protect his gruesome secret, will they be ever able to find their way out from the chamber of horrors which they discovered within the labyrinth?</p>

            <p><i>The Complete Aliens Omnibus – Volume 3</i> is available from 27 December 2016 in paperback (496 pages) and e-book format with RRP £8.99.</p>
