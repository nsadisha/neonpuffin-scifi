            <p>This open letter is a reaction to the article <b>“Should we be signalling our existence to alien life?”</b> published in <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com" title="Science Focus - a British monthly magazine about science and technology published by Immediate Media Company">Science Focus</a> issue 357 (December 2020), in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Vakoch" title="Douglas Vakoch, American psychologist, astrobiologist, SETI researcher and METI president">Douglas Vakoch</a>, president of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METI_(Messaging_Extraterrestrial_Intelligence)" title="METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) - organization that creates and transmits interstellar messages to communicate with extraterrestrial civilizations, headquartered in San Francisco, California, US">METI</a> (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence), talks about his organisation’s efforts of transmitting messages into the cosmos in the hope of establishing contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life.</p>

            <p>As a little boy, I was obsessed by contact with aliens. I was even attempting to send ‘them’ a message in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" title="Morse code - a method of telecommunication that encodes text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, short and long, or 'dots' and 'dashes'">Morse code</a> by flashing a torch from my bedroom window after being infatuated by 'contact' films such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind - American science fiction film written and directed by Steven Spielberg">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>. But as I have become older, wiser, and – you might say – more cynical, I have realised that I was rather naïve in my thinking back then and that advertising our position in the universe to others, without a thorough forethought, is at best foolishly careless and at worst can put the whole of mankind in jeopardy.</p>

                METI’s first message, aimed at the exoplanet GJ 273b - a potentially habitable world orbiting Luyten's Star - a red dwarf located in the constellation Canis Minor at a distance just over 12 light years from Earth, was transmitted by 930MHz UHF Radar from EISCAT facility in Ramfjordmoen, near Tromsø, Norway, back in 2017.

            <p>Now I came to understand that believing in benevolent extraterrestrials, descending from heavens eager to bestow their advanced technology upon the puny human race, is akin to hoping that America would readily share their nuclear know-how with the developing countries.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Very recently, I have learned about The <i>‘Dark Forest’</i> theory – <i>any more technologically advanced alien civilization will launch a pre-emptive strike against any less technologically advanced one to prevent it reaching the same or higher technological level and thus becoming a threat</i> – as postulated by science fiction writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin" title="Liu Cixin, prominent Chinese science fiction writer">Liu Cixin</a> in his <a href="tv-0046-the-three-body-problem.html" title="The Dark Forest - second book in Liu Cixin's trilogy of science fiction novels (the other two books being The Three-Body Problem and Death's End)">eponymous novel</a>.</p>
            <p>Even if we assume that the <i>‘Dark Forest’</i> theory is a bit too extreme, the reality is probably not that gloomy, and take the interaction of our very own human civilizations as an example, we will find, time and again, real-life situations throughout the history when the more developed society came across the less developed one – and it never ended up well for the latter one – Spanish conquest of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire" title="Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire">Aztec</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire" title="Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire">Inca</a> Empires being a good case in point.</p>
            <p>Likewise, even though we suppose that any alien civilization that might be the recipient of our message won’t be outwardly hostile or malevolent, the unfathomable implications of mere contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence on its own would cause a profound social, political, religious and economic upheaval on such an unimaginable scale that all the previous revolutions in the entire history of humanity would pale in comparison. If we again take the well-known precedent of our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbian_exchange" title="Columbian Exchange - the widespread two-way transfer of plants, animals, humans, diseases, culture, technology, religion and ideas between the Europe, Africa, Asia (Old World) and Americas (New World) in the 15th and 16th centuries">Columbian Exchange</a> as an example, history teaches us that such contacts have generally always led to a rapid decline or complete destruction of the 'contactee' civilization, as opposed to the 'contactor'.</p>

            <div class="picture_with_text_on_black align_left" style="text-align: left; width: 902px;">

                The effect of gunfire opened by Spaniards on Incans, who had never encountered firearms or cavalry before, was devastating and their seasoned warriors fled the battlefield in panic despite outnumbering the conquistadors 8,000 to 168. We can only speculate what sort of peculiar yet dreadful weapons could unleash an invading extraterrestrial force against our troops, but the odds are that the outcome of such a conflict wouldn't be much better for us, a newly emerging technological species.
            </div>

            <p>Similar opinions were expressed in the past by others, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" title="Stephen William Hawking, English theoretical physicist, cosmologist and popular science author">Stephen Hawking</a>, who in his 2010 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8642558.stm" title="Stephen Hawking's interview for BBC on 25 April 2010">interview</a> for BBC opined that, rather than actively trying to communicate with extraterrestrials, humans should do everything possible to avoid contact. <i>“If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans.”</i> He said, before continuing: <i>“We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn’t want to meet.”</i></p>

            <blockquote class="white" style="width: 250px; float: left;">
                <span>
                    The cosmos is mind-bogglingly vast and who knows - they just might have not noticed  us - so why take a chance ?
                </span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>And the <i>“They already know we are here anyway”</i> argument, used by METI’s president, simply does not stand. Omni-directional radio leakage, e.g. from the early television transmissions, are far more difficult to detect than a highly-focused signal sent from a powerful telescope in the direction of a specific target. The cosmos is <a href="misc-0013-universe-contains-ten-times-more-galaxies-than-astronomers-previously-thought.html" title="Universe contains ten times more galaxies than previously thought">mind-bogglingly vast</a>, and who knows –‘they’ just might have missed us – so why take a chance?</p>
            <p>More to the point, who gave <i>Douglas Vakoch</i> and his METI the right to decide such a critical issue with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole humankind by themselves?</p>
            <p>Therefore, to sum up: if we are already going to broadcast our existence and location to the stars for everyone out there to see, some broad international consensus should be reached first, ideally under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations (UN) - intergovernmental organization with aim to maintain international peace and security">UN</a> mandate. This view was recently echoed by a group of 28 astronomers, astrobiologists, theoretical physicists and other influential personalities connected with space exploration (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX" title="Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) - Aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California, US">SpaceX</a> founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" title="Elon Reeve Musk, business magnate, industrial designer and engineer">Elon Musk</a> and technology writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dyson_(science_historian)" title="George Dyson, American non-fiction author and historian of technology">George Dyson</a>, son of the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson" title="Freeman John Dyson, British-American theoretical and mathematical physicist and mathematician">Freeman Dyson</a>, amongst them), many associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_SETI_Research_Center" title="Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC) - research center based at the University of California, Berkeley, that engages in searching for optical and electromagnetic transmissions from intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations">BSRC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley - public land-grant research university in Berkeley, California, US, established in 1868">Berkeley, California</a>, who argue that <i>“Intentionally signalling other civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy raises concerns from all the people of Earth, about both the message and the consequences of contact.”</i>, before adding: <i>“As a newly emerging technological species, it is prudent to listen before we shout.“</i> and who issued and signed a statement in this regard: <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/meti_statement_0.html" title="Regarding Messaging To Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) / Active Searches For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Active SETI) - statement by a group of 28 astronomers, astrobiologists, theoretical physicists and other influential personalities, issued in 2016">Regarding Messaging To Extraterrestrial Intelligence</a> advocating against any impetuous messaging to extraterrestrial intelligences before <i>“a worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion occurs”</i>.</p>
            <p>Amen to that.</p>
